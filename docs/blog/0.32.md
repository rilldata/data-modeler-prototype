# Rill 0.32 -  Level Up Your Data Exploration üìà

:::note
‚ö° Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards.

:::


## ü¶Ü DuckSQL Comes to Sources with a YAML editor! 

DuckSQL support in source definition allows you to do more data wrangling during initial load.
The YAML editor makes it easy to specify custom schemas, filters, and aggregations to get your ducks in a row before analysis.


## üîç Introducing...Scrub-to-Zoom!
Just click and drag across any part of a timeseries charts to instantly select a subset of data.
Dynamically zoom in on the exact points of the timeseries that matter to you and dig in further.
It is like magic magnifying glass to investigate spikes, dips, anomalies or any area of interest. 
Go ahead - scrub your way to insights!

## üìÖ Friendlier interval formatting 
Intervals can now be formatted in friendly units like years, months, and days. This makes it way easier to see the time scale at a glance.
To format a metric as a pretty time interval, set `format-preset: interval_ms` in your dashboard spec.
The formatter assumes your interval is in milliseconds. If using a different unit, use a multiplier in your SQL to convert metric to milliseconds.

## ‚ö° Lightning Fast Data Exports and Parquet Support 

Export big data at warp speed! Rill now uses DuckDB‚Äôs `COPY TO` statement to execute CSV and Parquet data exports.
By pushing exports into the database, we reduce serialization overhead, leading to much improved performance.
Exporting 200 million rows now takes seconds instead of minutes.

## More Improvements to Explore
We packed even more enhancements into this release:

- **Easy Dashboard Discovery** - Finding your dashboards on Rill Cloud just got way simpler. The new homepage highlights your dashboards front and center.

- **Timezone Flexibility** - Want to disable timezone selection for a specific use-case? No prob! Just omit `available_timezones` in your dashboard spec.

- **Seamless Data Refresh** - Say goodbye to dashboard downtime during data refresh. Rill Cloud now updates your data seamlessly behind-the-scenes so your dashboards are always available.

With an array of upgrades both big and small, Rill 0.32 takes your data exploration to the next level. Try it out and let us know what you think!
