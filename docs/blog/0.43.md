## Smaller release
This time around we have a smaller release for you but we have been busy working on our next big feature, customizable dashboards and charts!
More information will follow as we are getting ready to release it, who knows you might even spot a sneak peek of it in the release gif?

## Embed project listing
Now you can embed the dashboard listing of a project and enable navigation between dashboards in a embed scenario. This is useful if you want to have multiple dashboards that your external users should be able to navigate between.

## Infinite scrolling on the pivot table
We have now released infinite scrolling in the pivot table, so that you can easily traverse enormous data set even in the pivot table.
As you scroll we will now seamlessly page in additional data for you!

## Pivot Exports
Want to export your data to Excel? Yup, now you can! Together with the other standard formats that we already support in Rill.

## Auto-save toggle for models
When working with large dataset or having models materialized, keystroke by keystroke updates can be a bit annoying.
We have no introduced a toggle so that you can opt-out of direct updates for models that require it!
