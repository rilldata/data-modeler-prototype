# Rill 0.43 - Embed project listings, pivot scrolling and working on something new!

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/existing-project) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## Smaller release
This time around we have a smaller release for you but we have been busy working on our next big feature, customizable dashboards and charts!
More information will follow as we are getting ready to release it, who knows you might even spot a sneak peek of it in the release gif?

## Embed project listing
Now you can embed the dashboard listing of a project and enable navigation between dashboards in a embed scenario. This is useful if you want to have multiple dashboards that your external users should be able to navigate between.

## Infinite scrolling on the pivot table
We have now released infinite scrolling in the pivot table, so that you can easily traverse enormous data set even in the pivot table.
As you scroll we will now seamlessly page in additional data for you!

## Pivot Exports
Want to export your data to Excel? Yup, now you can! Together with the other standard formats that we already support in Rill.

## Auto-save toggle for models
When working with large dataset or having models materialized, keystroke by keystroke updates can be a bit annoying.
We have now introduced a toggle so that you can opt-out of direct updates for models that require it!

## Bug Fixes and Misc
- Fixed a bug where deleting a source or model can sometimes trigger the underlying table to show up in the sidebar's tables list.
- Added support for alerts on externally managed tables.
- Improved hardening of the dashboard URL state.
- Added consistency to how the dimension table is rendered to ensure proper sizing and alignment.
- Added support for non-default schemas when using ClickHouse.
- Fixed issue where the runtime would sometimes re-ingest sources on restart (with external table storage enabled).
- Improved hardening of various frontend components.
- Fixed bug where mock users would no longer work correctly when assuming a mock user.
- Fixed bug where admins could not properly use the "View As" dropdown in Rill Cloud.
- Added hardening to prevent dashboards from occasionally falling into a perpetual loading state when viewing as a mock user with a limited security policy.
- Fixed a bug where changing the granularity would not always apply correctly to a dashboard when a zoom range is selected.
- Improved the styling of the nav bar.
- Rill Developer will now hide the `Edit model` menu item when there is no actual underlying model to edit (i.e. dashboard is built directly on top of a Source or Table resource)
- Added guardrails to prevent fetching of bookmarks for anonymous users on shared dashboards.
- Added UX improvements to the default Rill theme.
- Improved the sidebar layout and how it is animated, including how impacted elements will be positioned in the frontend.
- Added hardening to ensure that non-logged in users will be redirected to login when trying to access a shared dashboard link.
- Updated our Snowflake Go driver to address underlying bug related to empty arrow batches (see [SNOW-1222159](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/pull/1068)). 
- Added backend improvements to significantly enhance the performance of dashboards when using Druid as the OLAP engine.
- Disabled the profile view for any external table that is using a live connection (i.e. Druid or ClickHouse).
- Improved UX workflow for creating alerts so that it's available from the top bar (instead of the leaderboard).
- Added fix to use original names when querying `information_schema` in ClickHouse to allow support for older ClickHouse versions.
- Added hardening to source navigation to improve consistency when navigating from / to sources in Rill Developer.
- Upgraded the underlying version of DuckDB used in Rill to v0.10.1.
- Added shortcut to reports and alerts from the avatar dropdown when viewing a dashboard.
- Added a warning indicator in Rill Developer to call out unsupported data types in the UI when listing tables (rather than failing to load the entire table).
- Improved the color schema for categorical charts in Rill.
- Added further hardening in the application layer to improve query cancellation and requeuing logic.
- Improved the UX of pivot tables by separating out the totals data row. 
- Improved how security policies apply to alerts so that only admins and alert owners can fetch alert details but viewers will still be able to list alerts they have access to.
- Added fix to ensure proper percent-of-total calculations in the time dimension detail and leaderboard views.
- Enhanced the backend query optimization of the time dimension detail to reduce the number of queries sent and significantly improve the overall performance of the chart.
- Fixed bug where environment templating was not working correctly with custom SQL APIs.
- Improved the page load times and navigation latency of the UI.
- Updated the Druid driver in Rill to leverage the [Druid SQL API](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/api-reference/sql-api) instead
- Disabled search for non-string dimensions.
- Added support for multiple schemas when using a live connection with ClickHouse or Druid.
- Improved how dimensions and measures are validated in dashboards to parallelize and optimize performance.
