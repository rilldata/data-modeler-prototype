Today we are happy to drop some early holiday presents to all of our Rill users! üéÅüéÅ
In the spirit of more this release brings you just that, more of everything. Serving Rill content in more places, ingesting from more sources and more colors!

## Embedded Analytics

Now you can, securely, embed Rill content into your own solutions such as Salesforce or provide analytics directly to your customers from within your own product or portal.
With a few lines of code you can easily request a secure iframe url to your Rill dashboard that inherits features such as data security and user attribute templating. Explore our code samples and read more by visiting our docs page [here](TODO: NEEDS URL)

## Snowflake Connector

Got Snowflake? We have a connector for you!
Ingest data directly from Snowflake via the standard Rill UI without any fuss, plug in a SQL statement and a set of credentials and you are good to go.
Read more about how to configure the Snowflake connector by visiting our docs page [here](../../deploy/credentials/snowflake.md).

## Themes

This release contains our first release of Themes. In keeping with Rill tradition you can now define a theme resource kind that allows you to define primary and secondary colors. These colors will change the look and feel of your dashboards, either deploy themes to all your dashboards via project defaults in `rill.yaml` or on a per dashboard basis. We look forward to your feedback on Themes as we are looking into how to provide even more options for you in the future.
