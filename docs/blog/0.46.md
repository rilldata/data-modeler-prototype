## Comparisons everywhere!
Out of the box comparisons has always been a major part of Rill and now we have also added comparisons to Alerts and to the Pivot table.
This allows you to specify alert criteria on comparison values such as, "alert me if any of my top 100 customers has a decline in sales greater then 10% compared to last week". We also introduce comparisons to the pivot table where you now can easily toggle on or off time comparisons and easily track changes in your metrics while exploring in the pivot table. Enjoy!

## Rill Developer
In addition to various fixes and performance improvements we have are now grouping the Tables underneath their corresponding connectors for multi connector projects and bring-your-own-olap-engine projects.
