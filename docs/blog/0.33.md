## Unlock Advanced Security: Finer Grained Security Policies! 🛡️
Security policies let you micromanage access to your dashboards. Here’s what’s new:

- **Dashboard Access**: Handpick who gets a peek at specific dashboards.

- **Row-Level Access**: Use SQL filters to define which rows a user gets access to.

- **Selective Column Visibility**: Choose to include or exclude dimensions and measures depending on who's looking.

- **Mock users for easy testing**: When developing locally, you can use mock users to test your new granular security policies. Simply add them in your project’s rill.yaml file, then select them using the "View as" button on the dashboard.
  This lets you see what each user would see based on the policies you set.

### Imagining the Possibilities: How to Leverage Our New Security Policies 🌟
- **Team-specific Dashboards**: You can now define team or department specific data access rules on dashboards.
- **Tailored Partner Views**: Collaborating with external partners? Generate custom dashboards where external stakeholders only see the data directly relevant to them—no more, no less.
