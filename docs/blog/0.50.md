# Rill 0.50 - 

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!
