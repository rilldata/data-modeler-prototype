# Rill 0.47 - Public Links, User Groups, Host files and easier security rules.

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/existing-project) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## Public Links
Sometimes you want to provide a fast and filtered access to a dashboard, perhaps to a customer or partner, and now you can! Easily create a Public Link that takes any filters that were present at the point of creation and locks them down. This ensures that however you sent the link to can only see that specific slice of your data and can't navigate to other parts of your data that could be sensitive. Optionally add a expiration date for added security!


## User Groups
We have introduced the concept of user groups that allows you to assign users to groups.
User groups are ideal for when you want to manage access to dashboards or row level data access and don't want role based access. You can now write security rules such as `access: {{ has "finance" .user.groups }}` to easily manage access to resources in Rill. Use the CLI to add new groups and assign users to them, [read more here](/reference/cli/usergroup/usergroup), with a Rill Cloud UI based management coming soon!

## Host static files
By default we now serve any files placed inside of a `public` folder in the root of your project and you can configure additional folders via `public_paths` in [rill.yaml](/reference/project-files/rill-yaml). This will allow you host for example images, geojson or shapefiles that can used in new and exciting features coming soon, stay tuned!

## Security Rules
We have introduced the ability to utilize wildcards in inclusion and exclusion security rules to make avoid having to list all columns when defining inclusion and exclusion rules together. See more [here](/manage/security#use-wildcards-to-select-all-dimensions-and-measures).
