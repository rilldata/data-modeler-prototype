## Alerts
Our first release of the pivot table is now live and we are super excited! You can now freely explore your data in a tabular format by mixing and matching dimensions, measures and time to your own liking. This is our first release of the pivot table so any feedback is welcome and we have many more exciting enhancements planned for the future!

## Bookmarks
We have incorporated AI to quickly help you generate a dashboard from a model. With a single click Rill will now auto-generate a dashboard for you with a set of suggested measures and dimensions to help you get to a dashboard even faster!

## Custom SQL APIs
We have added a new driver for Clickhouse that allows you to have a live connection to a Clickhouse instance and directly create dashboards from your datasets.
Refer docs [here](../../build/credentials/clickhouse) for more details.


## Bug Fixes and Misc
- Fixed an issue where updates to dashboards were not always synced with the latest state when loading a pre-existing saved dashboard URL.
- Updated CSP to allow static UI assets / iframes to be embedded from any domain.
- Improved the aesthetic and readability of errors in leadership charts.
- Added hardening to prevent potential race condition with expired JWTs that could lead to HTTP 401 errors in a dashboard when the user is idle and returns to the dashboard after an extended period of time.
- Added search bar to the pivot table sidebar.
- Added an option to prefill certain measures and dimensions from the dashboard settings. 
- Added some UX improvements to the pivot table when selecting / dropping targets or using the sidebar.
- Adding support for additional predefined time range presets, including Yesterday, Previous Week Complete, Previous Month Complete, Previous Quarter Complete, and Previous Year Complete.
- Adding support for configuring the default OLAP engine directly through `rill.yaml` and with `rill env configure`.
- Added hardening to improve case sensitivity when validating dimension and measure names.
- Added hardening to prevent dashboards from crashing with a TypeError in very specific corner cases when hovering over line charts.
- Added hardening to prevent runtime panics from occurring when there is a missing `rill.yaml` in the project.
- Added support for passing custom themes to an embedded dashboard (iframe).
- Reverted and improved some UX designs related to the default header color of BigNumber and Leaderboard charts when themes are enabled.
- You can now enable the Data Viewer beta in Rill Cloud by appending the `?features=data-viewer` feature flag to the URL.
- Improved query cancellation in the backend when making multiple concurrent updates to a pivot table along with other general query cancellation improvements and hardening.
- Upgraded Go version to v1.22.
- Fixed bug where there could be a discrepancy between the percentage value shown in the dimension detail view and what the tooltip displays when hovering over the same value.
- Improved UX where a long measure value could potentially extend or overrun the cell that it belongs to.
- Improved UX to better maintain consistency of assigned comparison colors, including between line charts and dimension detail views.
- Changed `SameSite` attribute for cookies to `Lax`.
- Improved HTTP error handling to return cleaner and more clear messages.
- Added support for the `rill env push` and `rill env pull` CLI commands to push variables / credentials from a local `.env` to a cloud project and pull already defined variables / credentials to a local `.env` (which is part of `.gitignore`).
- Added hardening to prevent time dimension detail charts from hanging indefinitely when a request has failed and show an error state instead.
- Added hardening to improve error handling by the runtime for cancelled queries.
- Added sidebar navigation to charts and custom dashboards in Rill Developer (currently in beta so will require adding the `?features=custom-dashboards` feature flag to the Rill Developer URL).
- Relaxed naming constraints to allow for periods and an expanded set of characters in object names (e.g. sources). 
- Added hardening to minimize scenarios where HTTP 429 errors could be triggered in a dashboard.
- Improved handling of `LowCardinality` nullable data types when using the ClickHouse OLAP engine.
- Improved backend error handling when the runtime doesn't find a column that it expects in a dashboard (for example - if a project wide default had been configured for `timeseries`).
- Added support for pan interactions within dashboards via arrow icons and left-right keys so that users can quickly shift forwards or backwards on time series charts using the currently defined time period (e.g. current week, last week, the week before, etc.)
- Fixed bug where a relative duckdb database file that was included in a subdirectory of the Git project couldn't be used by the DuckDB connector when the project has been deployed to Rill Cloud.
- Added support for sorting by multiple measures when using a pivot table.
- Improved and made more explicit available iframe options that can be configured through the API.
- Improved how dimension and measure names are stored in the dashboard URL state.
- Added tooltip in the Rill Cloud UI to display the full error message when hovering on the Status page.
- Added hardening to improve the UI consistency to our chart components.
- Added shorthands for configuring environment-specific overrides for the `dev` and `prod` environments.
- Fixed the leaderboard column alignment so that the column values are better right-aligned (instead of left-aligned).
- Fixed bug where having an incorrect condition could prevent a measure filter from being applied.
- Added support for serving Rill Developer over HTTPS by passing in appropriate `--cert` and `--key` flags via the CLI.
