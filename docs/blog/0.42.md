## Alerts
Our first release of the pivot table is now live and we are super excited! You can now freely explore your data in a tabular format by mixing and matching dimensions, measures and time to your own liking. This is our first release of the pivot table so any feedback is welcome and we have many more exciting enhancements planned for the future!

## Bookmarks
We have incorporated AI to quickly help you generate a dashboard from a model. With a single click Rill will now auto-generate a dashboard for you with a set of suggested measures and dimensions to help you get to a dashboard even faster!

## Custom SQL APIs
We have added a new driver for Clickhouse that allows you to have a live connection to a Clickhouse instance and directly create dashboards from your datasets.
Refer docs [here](../../build/credentials/clickhouse) for more details.
