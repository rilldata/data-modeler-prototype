## Overview

Bookmarks are useful to return to regular analyses and filter sets commonly used for reporting or deep dives. If you have a regular view of the data, a bookmark is also a good replacement rather than creating an entirely new dashboard as it contains a subset of the view while retaining all of the fields available for analysis.

Common use cases for Bookmarks include:
- Weekly/Monthly reporting
- Setting filters for specific users/use cases (eg. teams or executives with a narrower view, an account manager's book of clietns)
- Answering common troubleshooting questions by starting with a subset of problem dimensions
