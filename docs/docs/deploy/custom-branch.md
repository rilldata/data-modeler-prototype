# Change your production branch

By default, Rill deploys from the [default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch) of your git repository. You can change this to any branch you want.

To deploy your project from a different branch, run the following command:

```bash
rill deploy --prod-branch [PROD-BRANCH]
```
