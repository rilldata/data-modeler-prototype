In Rill Cloud, access can be granted at the organization or project level. You manage access using the Rill CLI.

## Install and authenticate the Rill CLI

If you have not already installed the Rill CLI, see [Install Rill](../develop/install.md).

To manage cloud permissions with the Rill CLI, you must first authenticate it. If you have not already done so, run:
```
rill login
```

## Manage members of an organization

When you invite a user to an organization on Rill Cloud, they automatically get access to *all projects* in the organization. Users can have one of two roles:

- **Viewers** can browse projects and view their dashboards
- **Admins** can additionally create and edit projects, and view and edit members

### Add a member

To add a member to an org, run the following command:
```
rill user add
```
You will then be prompted for details about the user.

If you add a user who has not yet signed up for Rill, they will receive an email inviting them to join.

### Other actions

Run `rill user --help` to show commands for listing members or changing access.

## Manage members of a project

By default, adding a user to an organization grants them access to all its projects. You can alternatively add a user only to a specific project. Users can have one of two roles on a project:

- **Viewers** can view the project's dashboards
- **Admins** can additionally edit the project, and view and edit project members

### Add a member

To add a member to a project, run the following command:
```
rill user add --project [PROJECT NAME]
```
You will then be prompted for details about the user. HINT: Run `rill project list` to show available projects.

If you add a user who has not yet signed up for Rill, they will receive an email inviting them to join.

### Other actions

Run `rill user --help` to show commands for listing members or changing access.

## Make a project public

Projects on Rill Cloud are private by default. To make a project's dashboards publicly accessible without authentication, run:
```
rill project edit --public=true
```

Warning: If you make a project public, make sure it does not expose confidential data.
