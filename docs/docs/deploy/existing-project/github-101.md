## Overview

To share dashboards with other users, Rill utilizes GitHub as a means of version control - effectively creating BI-as-code. There are several advantages to Git as the backend for dashboards: develop locally, integrate into existing development workflows, and manage versions + change control. While many users are familiar with Git and basic commands, there are other Rill users who are relatively new to Git. 

In this section, we will outline: 

- Installing the Git desktop app (recommended for those less familiar with Git vs. using the command line)
- Setting up your repository (repo) and cloning to your local
- Pushing changes to Git
- Deploying Rill to your new org to share dashboards, set up alerts and receive scheduled reports
