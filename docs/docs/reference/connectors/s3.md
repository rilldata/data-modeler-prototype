## Create a service account

Follow the steps below to create an AWS service account for connecting to an S3 bucket from Rill Cloud.

### Using the AWS Management Console

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create an AWS service account with read-only access to S3:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the [IAM dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the sidebar, select "Users" and click the "Add users" button.

3. Enter a username for the service account and click "Next".

4. Select "Attach existing policies directly" and search for the "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess" policy. Check the box next to the policy to select it and click "Next". Then, under "Set permissions boundaries and tags", click the "Create user" button.

5. On the "Users" page, navigate to the newly created user and go to the "Security credentials" tab.

7. Under the "Access keys" section, click "Create access key".

8. On the "Access key best practices & alternatives" screen, select "Third-party service", confirm the checkbox, and click "Next".

9. On the "Set description tag" screen, optionally enter a description, and click "Create access key".

10. Note down the "Access key" and "Secret access key" values for the service account. (Hint: Click the ‚ùê icon next to the secrets to copy them to the clipboard.)

### Using the `aws` CLI

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create an AWS service account with read-only access to S3 using the AWS CLI:

1. Open a terminal window and [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) if it is not already installed on your system.

2. Run the following command to create a new user for your service account (optionally replace `rill-service-account` with a name of your choice):
```bash
aws iam create-user --no-cli-pager --user-name rill-service-account
```

3. Run the following command to attach the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy to the user:

```bash
aws iam attach-user-policy \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess \
    --user-name rill-service-account
```

4. Run the following command to create an access key pair for the user:

```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name rill-service-account
```

5. Note down the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` values in the returned JSON object. Click "q" to exit the page.
