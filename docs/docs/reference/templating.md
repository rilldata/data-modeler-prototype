Rill uses the Go programming language's native templating engine, known as `text/template`, which you might know from projects such as [Helm](https://helm.sh/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It additionally includes the [Sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) library of utility functions.

## Example

Access an environment variable provided using `rill start --var key=value`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_source WHERE foo = '{{ .vars.key }}'
```
