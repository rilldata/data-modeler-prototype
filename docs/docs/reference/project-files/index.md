When you create sources, models, and dashboards, these objects are represented as YAML files on the file system. You can find these files in your `source`, `models` and `dashboards` folders in your project. 

Projects can simply be rehydrated from Rill project files into an explorable data application as long as there is sufficient access and credentials to the source data - figuring out the dependencies, pulling down data, & validating your model queries and metrics configurations. The result is a set of functioning exploratory dashboards.

You can see an example project by visiting our [example github repository](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-developer-example.git).
