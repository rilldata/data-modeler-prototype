When you create sources, models, and metrics versions we create code-representations on your behalf on the file system. You can see these files in your `source`, `models` and `dashboards` folders in your project. 

Projects can be "re-hydrated" from Rill project files into an explorable data application - figuring out the dependencies, pulling down data, & validating your model queries and metrics configurations. The result is a set of functioning exploratory dashboards.

You can see an example project by visiting our [example github repository](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-developer-example.git).
