Canvas dashboards are composed of one more more charts. Now that we've learned how to create charts via Rill-provided templates and via custom chart with vega-lite, we can add and arrange these on Canvas dashboard.


### Create a Canvas dashboard
Via the UI, select `Canvas Dashboard`

You will notice three options in the UI for creating dashboards.
- code
- split
- viz



![project-view](/img/tutorials/301/custom-dashboard.png)

In both the split and viz mode, we can drag and drop chart components into the Canvas dashboard.
You'll notice that in the YAML for the dashboard, you can adjust the `columns`, which will adjust the number of squares on the screen. Let's go ahead and drag our two custom charts that we built!

<img src = '/img/tutorials/301/custom-chart.gif' class='rounded-gif' />

Using the markdown component under `items`, we can label the highest contributors chart and set the background white.

Finally, using some of the Rill template KPI charts, we can finish off the Canvas dashboard by showing some easy to understand charts, along with a title.

These are just two simple custom graphs that can be built using Vega Lite. Please refer to Vega Lite [documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/) and [examples](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) for further inspiration on how you can build your very own Canvas dashboard.
