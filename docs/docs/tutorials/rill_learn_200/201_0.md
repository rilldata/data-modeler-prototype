## Rill Cloud


So, we've deployed to Rill Cloud. But... what is Rill Cloud and how was it different from Rill Developer? For an indepth comparison between the two platforms, please refer to the concepts article: <a href= 'https://docs.rilldata.com/concepts/developerVsCloud' target="blank ">Rill Cloud vs. Rill Developer</a>.

To summarize:

- Rill Developer is for development and testing and is run locally, `localhost`.
- Rill Cloud is for your deployed dashboard and available on the web, `https://ui.rilldata.com/<your_org>`


## Rill Cloud UI
Let's take another look at some of the UI components to better understand Rill Cloud.

From the organization page, you can see a list of available projects, each displayed as a square in the UI. In this case, we just have our single project, my-rill-tutorial. Note that this name is derived from the original `rill start my-rill-tutorial` and is based on the parent folder name. You can change the project name via the [CLI](https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/cli/project/).
