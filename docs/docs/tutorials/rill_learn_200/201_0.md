## Glad to see you made it!


So, we've deployed to Rill Cloud. But... what is Rill Cloud? How is it different from Rill Developer? 

To summarize the previous course:

1. Rill Developer is for... Developers.
2. Rill Cloud are for dashboard consumers.
3. The modifiable features differ on both platforms. IE: Cloud can make alerts, while Developer creates dashboards.

However, for a more indepth comparison between the two platforms, please refer to the documentation!
