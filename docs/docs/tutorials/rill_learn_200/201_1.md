## How to manage the users?



## Via UI
Starting from 0.48, we are starting to roll out some UI features for user managment with more features coming soon.

Please refer to the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/user-management#via-the-ui' target = "blank">documentation how a user can request access to project, or how an admin canset project access. </a>

import ComingSoon from '@site/src/components/ComingSoon';

<ComingSoon />

<div class='contents_to_overlay'>
Historically (pre 0.48), user management was only possible via the CLI. Now, it is also possible to do so via the UI! 

</div>

## Via CLI

The two commands that you will need to use for user management in rill is `user` and `usergroup`.

### Let's see the Rill commands

```

### Let's request access to the project from another user

Let's access the following URL of your deployed organization 
```
https://ui.rilldata.com/<your_org>/my-rill-tutorial
```

You can access the following site on an in-cognito window to request access from another email.

Once you approve the request of access to the project, you can check this via the CLI:
```bash
 rill user list --project my-rill-tutorial
  NAME       EMAIL                       ROLE     CREATED ON            UPDATED ON           
 ---------- --------------------------- --------- --------------------- --------------------- 
  Roy Endo   <your_email>@domain.com     viewer   2024-05-16 01:08:14   2024-08-21 08:52:19  
  Roy Endo   roy.endo@rilldata.com       admin    2024-07-02 23:33:57   2024-08-15 16:58:08  
```

However, you'll notice that if you list the organizational users, the above user is not shown, **why?**

```bash
rill user list
  NAME       EMAIL                   ROLE    CREATED ON            UPDATED ON           
 ---------- ----------------------- ------- --------------------- --------------------- 
  Roy Endo   roy.endo@rilldata.com   admin   2024-07-02 23:33:57   2024-08-15 16:58:08 
  ```

  Within Rill, there are [three levels where a user may gain access](https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/project-management): 
  
  1. Organization
  2. Project-level
  3. User group

When a user is requesting access to the project via the UI, this adds the user at the _project level_. In order to add a user to the organization, you will need to do so via the CLI. For more information on what the difference is between the permission granted, please refer to [our documentation](https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/roles-permissions).

```bash
rill user add
```



### Usergroups
As the name suggests, user groups are designed to group your users together so that you do not need to set permissions on each user. Simply adding the user to the group, the users will inherit permissions from the group.

By default, all-users will be created in your environment. Let's add a `tutorial-admin` group.
```
rill usergroup list

  NAME        ROLE   CREATED ON            UPDATED ON           
 ----------- ------ --------------------- --------------------- 
  all-users   -      2024-08-01 09:32:29   2024-08-01 09:32:29  
```

```
rill usergroup create

? Enter user group name tutorial-admin
User group "tutorial-admin" created in organization "Rill_Learn"
```
Now let's give admin access to the group for the project `my-rill-tutorial`.


```
rill usergroup add --project my-rill-tutorial
? Select role admin
? Enter user group name tutorial-admin
Role "admin" added to user group "tutorial-admin" in project "my-rill-tutorial"
```

Next, let's try to add your user to this group and see what happens.

```bash
rill user add --group tutorial-admin
? Enter email <your_email>@domain.com 
? The user must be a member of "<your_org>" to join one of its groups. Do you want to invite the user to join "<your_org>"? Yes
User "<your_email>@domain.com " added to the organization "<your_org>" as "viewer"
User "<your_email>@domain.com " added to the user group "tutorial-admin"
```

Since the user was added to the project only, not the organization, when adding the user to a usergroup (which requires the user to be a part of the organization), we will prompt if you'd like to invite the user to the organization. Once added to the organization, the user will be added to the usergroup.

Let's confirm that the user is part of the user group.

```bash
rill user list --group tutorial-admin
```

Let's navigate to our project, my-rill-tutorial, to see some differences between viewer and admin.
