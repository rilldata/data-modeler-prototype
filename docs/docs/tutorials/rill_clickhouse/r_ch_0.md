**Welcome to Rill**


In this course, we will accomplish the following:

- Install the Rill binary locally [Linux/MacOS and Windows]
- Start Rill from the CLI and use a sample project to get started
- Connect to your Clickhouse Cloud instance. 
- Notes CH local vs CH Cloud
- Visualize your tables locally in Rill.


<br />


> insert a diagram on how Rill and CH connect, maybe somethign official? more loose?

<> Would make sense to use the uk_... dataset that they should have already been using if following the CH dev guide </>
