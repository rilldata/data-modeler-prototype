## Testing the deployed APIs

Let's use the following to return the results from the CLI:

```bash
curl https://admin.rilldata.com/v1/orgs/Rill_tutorials/projects/my-rill-tutorial/runtime/api/SQL_api \
-H "Authorization: Bearer rill_svc_<random_string>"
```

Since this is from the service token, which acts as a admin user on the organization, you will be able to return the results.
