## Getting started with custom APIs

Our [custom APIs](https://docs.rilldata.com/integrate/custom-api#accessing-custom-apis) support both GET and POST requests to the API endpoint that exist under the `/apis/` folder in your project.

GET:
```bash
curl https://admin.rilldata.com/v1/orgs/<org-name>/projects/<project-name>/runtime/api/<api-name>[?query-args] \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

POST:
```bash
curl -X POST https://admin.rilldata.com/v1/orgs/<org-name>/projects/<project-name>/runtime/api/<api-name>[?query-args] \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

In order to send the request to the API endpoint, you will need to setup the token via the CLI. There are two types of bearer tokens:

- Service Account token
- User Token


### Accessing custom APIs
For our example, let's create both a **service account token** and a **user token** to see the difference in the responses.

Navigate back to the CLI to run the following command:
```bash
rill service create my-api-service
Created service "my-api-service" in org "Rill_Learn".
Access token: rill_svc_<RANDOM_STRING>
```

Once this is created, you can use the service access token to create a user token. From our previous example, dashboard_1 has the following access policies applied:

```yaml
security:
  access: "{{ .user.admin }} "
```
This access policy allows admins to view this dashboard only. For the user token below, please select an email for a user that is a viewer to the project, `my-rill-tutorial`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://admin.rilldata.com/v1/organizations/Rill_tutorials/projects/my-rill-tutorial/credentials \
-H "Authorization: Bearer rill_svc_<RANDOM_STRING>"
--data-raw '{
  "user_email":"<user-email>"
}'
```

This will return a reponse which you will need to extract the accessToken.
