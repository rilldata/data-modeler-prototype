There are more customizations that we can add to the YAML file. 


### Configuration ###
For some basic configurations for the metrics-view:

```yaml
smallest_time_grain: day #this limits that smallest amount a user can drill
first_day_of_week: 7 #Whether you prefer a Sunday start or Monday, how about Wednesday?
first_month_of_year: 2 #Usually its January, but who knows? Lunar New Years?
```

### Defaults ###
For setting default view when the dashboard is opened by a new user:

```yaml
default_time_range: P3M #valid ISO 8601, RILL ISO 8601
default_comparison: #defaults to none,
	mode: dimension #none,time,dimension
	dimension: Company#column name
	#sets the dashboard to compare companies by default.
default_dimensions: #default selected dimensions when dashboard is open
default_measures: #default selected measures when dashboard is open
default_theme: #must be pre-created under /theme/<theme_name>.yaml
```

### available selectors ###
If you want to limit the default selection of time ranges and time zones

```yaml
available_time_zones: #overrides the default time ranges that can be selected by users
available_time_ranges: #overrides the default list of time ranges that can be selected by users
```

### Other ###
These will be discussed in a further topic, but you can set a OLAP engine on a specific dashboard as well as set up access policies.

```yaml
connector: <OLAP_ENGINE>
security: ...
```

Let's build out our dashboard for a bit more functionality!
