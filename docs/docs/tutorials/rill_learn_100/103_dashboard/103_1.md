### Our current metrics view state: 
```yaml
# Dashboard YAML
# Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/dashboards

type: metrics_view #the type is required for all YAML files in Rill to define the type

title: "Dashboard Title"
table: example_table # Choose a table [or model] to underpin your dashboard / 
timeseries: timestamp_column # Select an actual timestamp column (if any) from your table

dimensions:
  - column: category
    label: "Category"
    description: "Description of the dimension"

measures:
  - expression: "SUM(revenue)"
    label: "Total Revenue"
    description: "Total revenue generated"

```

Let's go through the requirements one by one. 

---

### Type ###

```yaml
type: metrics_view
```
The type is a Rill required key pair as it indicates to Rill what type of file this is. Whether a `source`, `metrics_vew`, `connector`, etc. We can keep this as is.

---

### Title and underlying table ###
```yaml
title: "My Tutorial dashboard"

#table: example_table # OR
model: commit___model
```
The title will be displayed in the metrics-view UI and should be defined as required. <br />
Depending on your use-case, `table` or `model` will be used to underpin your dashboard.<br />

Let's go ahead and change the title to `My Tutorial dashboard` and comment out the table and add `model: commit___model`.


---

### Time series ###
```yaml
timeseries: author_date # Select an actual timestamp column (if any) from your table
```
The timeseries column is a Date type column within your table. While technically this is not required, many of the features require a timeseries column and your resulting dashboard will lack key functionality. Let's set this to `author_date`.

---
### Dimensions ###
```yaml

dimensions:
  - column: author_name #the column name in the table
    label: "The Author's Name" #A label
    description: "The name of the author of the commit" #A description, displayed when hovered over dimension

```
Dimensions are used for exploring segments and filtering the dashboard. You will need to set the column assign it a label and provide a description. The description will be displayed when hovering over, and can provide more context.

Our first dimension wil be the author's name. Let's go ahead and make the changes above.

---
### Measures ###

```yaml
measures:
  - expression: "SUM(added_lines)"
    label: "Sum of Added lines"
    description: "The aggregate sum of added_lines column"
```

Measure are the numeric aggreagtes of columns from your data model. These function will use DuckDB SQL aggregation functions and expressions. 

Our first measure will be the sum of `added_lines`.

---

At this point our dashboard should be previewable! 
Let's go ahead a select preview so we can take a look at the changes we made.

>> insert simple video/gif of the simple dashboard 1 measure, 1 dimension.


We can definitely do better than that!

  <summary>Dashboard not working?</summary>
  
    Go ahead and copy the YAML below into your dashboard.
  ```yaml
# Dashboard YAML
# Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/dashboards

type: metrics_view

title: "My Tutorial Project"
#table: example_table # Choose a table to underpin your dashboard
model: commits___model

timeseries: author_date # Select an actual timestamp column (if any) from your table

dimensions:
  - column: author_name
    label: "The Author's Name"
    description: "The name of the author of the commit"

measures:
  - expression: "SUM(added_lines)"
    label: "Sum of Added lines"
    description: "The aggregate sum of added_lines column."


```
