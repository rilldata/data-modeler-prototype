**Installing Rill [Linux / MacOS]**

Let’s install the Rill binary to your local machine.

You can follow the steps in <a href="https://docs.rilldata.com/" target="_blank"> our documentation</a> or run the following from the CLI:

- On MacOS, open the CLI by searching for “Terminal” in Spotlight.

<LoomVideo loomId="74032007fb2e45acabf5e7488341148a?hideEmbedTopBar=true&" />
<br />

Once this is open run the following:

```yaml
curl https://rill.sh | sh
rill start my-rill-project
```

  <summary>Windows Installation Instructions</summary>

  On Windows, you can search for "Command Prompt" (note that there are extra steps to get Rill running on Windows; please refer to the <a href="https://docs.rilldata.com/" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more details).
  
  ``` yaml
        wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
  ```
  Once the installation completes, and you have logged into the Linux instance, you need to install the unzip package using the following lines: 

    ```yaml
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install unzip
    ```

    Finally, you can install Rill!
        ``` yaml 
            curl https://rill.sh | sh

    ```
