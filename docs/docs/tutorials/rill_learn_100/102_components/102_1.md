Let's start at the beginning of all data pipelines, the `source`.

**What is a Source?**

In Rill, the source is your data. Whether this is from a data warehouse, cloud storage, or a RDB, Rill can connect to it via an underlying DuckDB process. 

> By default, the underlying OLAP engine is DuckDB (can be modified: see Connect OLAP engines) and when connecting to an external data source, the data is ingested locally.

Please see our docs for a full 
<a href="https://docs.rilldata.com/build/connect/" target="_blank">supported list</a> of connectors.




### Adding a source is simple! 

Select the `+Add` dropdown and select Data, this will open a UI of supported connectors

<br />

For our tutorial, let's add 

```yaml 
 <some link, waiting for Alex>
```

Once imported, youll see the UI change with a few things..
1. The `source_nam`.YAML file created in the file explorer
1. DuckDB database, created in the Connectors explorer
2. Within the DuckDB, our imported data.

Now we're ready to create a `model`.
