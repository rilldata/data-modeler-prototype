**What is a Metrics View?**

A metrics view is a dashboard where you can visualize and drill down into your data.

### Let's create a metrics view!

Now that the model is created, we can create a metrics-view. There are two ways to do so:
1. Generate dashboard with AI
2. Start Simple using the +Add, Dashboard 

<details>
  <summary>How does Generate dashboard with AI work?</summary>
  
    We send a set of YAML and project files to GPT-4o to suggest the dimensions, measures, and various other key pairs for your dashboard.

Let's go ahead and create a simple dashboard via the UI and build onto it.

As you can see, the default dashboard YAML is as follows:

```yaml
# Dashboard YAML
# Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/dashboards

type: metrics_view #the type is required for all YAML files in Rill to define the type

title: "Dashboard Title"
table: example_table # Choose a table [or model] to underpin your dashboard / 
timeseries: timestamp_column # Select an actual timestamp column (if any) from your table

dimensions:
  - column: category
    label: "Category"
    description: "Description of the dimension"

measures:
  - expression: "SUM(revenue)"
    label: "Total Revenue"
    description: "Total revenue generated"

```
We'll get into the nitty gritty details of all the YAML components in a second.
For now, you'll see a red box around the UI and the preview button grayed out. This indicates something is wrong with the YAML.
