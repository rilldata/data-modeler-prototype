### What is a model?
<div className="center-content">

A data model in Rill is a used to perform intermediate processing as well as any last mile ETL on the source data required. We recommend creating a <a href="https://docs.rilldata.com/build/models/#one-big-table-and-dashboarding" target="_blank">"One Big Table"</a> for your dashboards.

### Let's create a model from our source data

Go ahead and select the `Create Model` button in the top right hand corner.

<img src = '/img/tutorials/102/Add-Model.gif' class='rounded-gif' />
<br />

You'll see a new UI appear automatically and the contents are auto populated with some SQL. This is our Model page.
```SQL
select * from commits__
```

Let's try to make some changes to our SQL and see how the UI reacts.

```SQL
select * from commits order by author_date DESC
```
Notice that the preview table is automatically updated as we modify the SQL. This is due to our auto-save feature. In case of any errors that are encountered the UI will update accordingly and display the error.

 Our Autosave feature can be enabled/disabled as needed via the rill.yaml file / project settings, or by simply selecting the toggle in the UI.

### Concept: What is materialization?

By default, models created in DuckDB will be views. Both views and tables will be shown in under your DuckDB's connector table view.

However, there are times where youâ€™d rather materialize these as tables by adding the following to the SQL file

```yaml
-- @materialize: true
```

  <summary>Why materialize?</summary>
  
   You may experience some improved performance materializing SQL views for intermediate models in the case of complex SQL or large data.

    We generally recommend materializing finals models that power dashboards.

    However, you might experience some degradation of modeling experience [auto-save feature] for some specific situations including cross joins.
