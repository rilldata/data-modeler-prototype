**Ready to Deploy?**

In order to prepare the environment for deployment to Cloud we will need to return to the CLI where we started Rill Developer to run a few commands.

Let's get started by running  `rill` in the Terminal and seeing the output:

```
Rill CLI

Usage:
  rill [command]

Available Commands:
  start          Build project and start web app
  deploy         Deploy project to Rill Cloud
  env            Manage variables for a project
  user           Manage users
  usergroup      Manage user groups
  org            Manage organisations
  project        Manage projects
  share-url      Manage shareable URLs
  service        Manage service accounts
  login          Authenticate with the Rill API
  logout         Logout of the Rill API
  whoami         Show current user
  docs           Open docs.rilldata.com
  version        Show Rill version
  upgrade        Upgrade Rill to the latest version
  uninstall      Uninstall the Rill binary
  billing        Billing related commands for org
  help           Help about any command

Flags:
      --api-token string   Token for authenticating with the cloud API
      --format string      Output format (options: "human", "json", "csv") (default "human")
  -h, --help               Print usage
      --interactive        Prompt for missing required parameters (default true)
  -v, --version            Show rill version

Use "rill [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
There's quite a bit but dont worry, we don't need to worry about all of them... for now!

The ones we will use this time are as follows:
1. Create an Organization (rill org)
2. Create Users [if required] (rill user)
3. Create/Manage credentials [if required] (rill env)
4. Deploy! (rill deploy)

In our current example, we wont need to follow all the steps but 2 and 3 but we'll go over them for information purposes.
