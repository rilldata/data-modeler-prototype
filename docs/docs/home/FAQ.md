## Getting Started

### What is Rill?
Rill is an operational BI tool that provides fast dashboards that your team will actually use. Rillâ€™s unique architecture combines a last-mile ETL service, an in-memory database, and operational dashboards - all in a single solution

### How do I install Rill? 
You can install rill using our installation script:
```bash
curl https://rill.sh | sh
```
### How do I upgrade Rill to the latest version?
If you installed Rill using the installation script described above, you can upgrade by running:
```
rill upgrade
```


### Rill cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
This occurs when Rill binary is downloaded via the browser. You need to change the permissions to make it executable and remove it from Apple Developer identification quarantine. 
Below CLI commands will help you to do that: 
```bash
chmod a+x rill
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./rill
```


### Error - This macOS version is not supported. Please upgrade.
Rill uses duckDB internally which requires a newer [macOS version](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/3824). 
Please upgrade your macOS version to 10.14 or higher.


### How do I uninstall Rill?

You can uninstall Rill using the following command:
```bash
rill uninstall
```

### How do I make changes to my dashboard in Rill Cloud?

You can follow the same steps as above. The button will have changed from `deploy` to `update`. After selecting this, the objects in your Rill project will be updated.

### How do I share my dashboard to other users?

You will need to [invite users to your organization/project](https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/user-management#option-1---admin-invites-user) or send them a URL for them to [request access to your dashboard](https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/user-management#option-2---user-requests-access). If you just want them to see the contents of your dashboard, you can look into using [public URLs](https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/share-url).
