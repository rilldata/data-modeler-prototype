## Getting Started

### What is Rill?
Rill is an operational BI tool that provides fast dashboards that your team will actually use. Rillâ€™s unique architecture combines a last-mile ETL service, an in-memory database, and operational dashboards - all in a single solution

## Install Rill 

### How do I install Rill? 
You can install rill using our installation script:
```bash
curl https://rill.sh | sh
```
### How do I upgrade Rill to the latest version?
If you installed Rill using the installation script described above, you can upgrade by running:
```
rill upgrade
```


### Rill cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
This occurs when Rill binary is downloaded via the browser. You need to change the permissions to make it executable and remove it from Apple Developer identification quarantine. 
Below CLI commands will help you to do that: 
```bash
chmod a+x rill
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./rill
```


### Error - This macOS version is not supported. Please upgrade.
Rill uses duckDB internally which requires a newer [macOS version](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/3824). 
Please upgrade your macOS version to 10.14 or higher.


### How do I uninstall Rill?

You can uninstall Rill using the following command:
```bash
rill uninstall

### What is Rill Cloud?
Rill Cloud is where your deployed Rill project exists and can be shared to your colleagues, or end-users. For more information, please review [our documentation](https://docs.rilldata.com/concepts/developerVsCloud#rill-cloud).

### How do I deploy to Rill Cloud?
You can deploy your project directly from the UI by selecting [the Deploy button](/deploy/deploy-dashboard/#deploying-a-project-from-rill-developer).

<br />


### How do I make changes to my dashboard in Rill Cloud?

You can follow the same steps as above. The button will have changed from `deploy` to `update`. After selecting this, the objects in your Rill project will be updated. Or, after syncing your Rill project to Github, simply push changes directly to the repository and this will automatically update your project on Rill Cloud.

### How do I share my dashboard to other users?

You will need to [invite users to your organization/project](https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/user-management#option-1---admin-invites-user) or send them a URL for them to [request access to your dashboard](https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/user-management#option-2---user-requests-access). If you just want them to see the contents of your dashboard, you can look into using [public URLs](https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/share-url).

### When does my trial start?
Your trial will start when you deploy a project to Rill Cloud from Rill Developer. An Organization will be autoamatically created during this process using your email and the project will be the folder that your Rill project exists in. You can change the name using [CLI commands](https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/cli/project/rename). 

### How long does my Rill Cloud Trial last?
A Rill Cloud trial lasts for 30 days. If you have any comments or concerns, please reach out to us on our [various platforms](../contact.md)! 

### What is included in the free trial? 
The free trial is locked at 2 projects and up to 10GB of data each. You can invite as many users as required and there are no locked features. 

### What happens to my project if I do not upgrade to a Team plan?
Your projects will hibernate. Your project metadata will still be available once you've activated your team plan. If you'd like to delete your deployment from Rill Cloud, you can do so via the [CLI commands.](https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/cli/org/delete)

![expired](/img/FAQ/expired-project.png)

### What is project hibernation?
When a project is inactive for a specific number of days or your trial has expired, we automatically hibernate the project. What this means is that all of your information and metadata is saved and resource consumption will be zero. You will need to unhibernate the project to gain access to the dashboard again. 

If the project is hibernated due to payment issues, the project will stay in this state until payment is confirmed. Once the payment is confirmed, you can reaccess the project with the following CLI command.
```
rill project hibernate <project_id> --redeploy
```
