This  will guide you through using incremental models which allows you to split a model execution into smaller, incremental steps. This feature helps optimize performance and manage large datasets more effectively.

## 1. Understanding Splits in Models

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Split Definition**: Each row from the result set becomes one "split". The model processes each split separately.
- **Execution Strategy**:
  - **First Split**: Runs without incremental processing.
  - **Subsequent Splits**: Run incrementally, following the output connector's `incremental_strategy` (either append or merge for SQL connectors).

## 2. Configure Split Execution

* Use `glob:` resolver to load files from cloud storage ( S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
* Set `incremental` to true if you want only new or re-triggered splits to execute when the model runs.
* Configure `splits_watermark` to automatically detect changes in data.

**3: Executing Splits**

To execute a split, use the `rill project splits` command. You can also trigger specific splits using flags like `--split-errors` or `--split`.

**Example Use Cases**

1. **Load files from S3**: Use one split per file to load data into DuckDB.
    * `splits:` resolver with glob pattern: `s3://bucket/data/**/*.parquet`
2. **Incrementally load files from S3**: Use one split per Hive partition to load data into ClickHouse.
    * `incremental`: true
    * `connector`: clickhouse
3. **Split materialization of a derived DuckDB model**: Split the execution of a heavy transformation step by date.
    * `splits:` resolver with SQL query: `SELECT DISTINCT date_trunc('DAY', day) as day FROM source`

**Next Steps**

To explore further features, use:

* CLI flags like `rill project splits [--errors] [--pending]` to list errored or pending splits
* CLI flag `rill project splits [--recent]` to order splits by most recently executed
* Trigger specific splits with `rill project refresh --model mymodel [--full] [--split KEY] [--split-errors]:`
