lore using some of [Vega-Lite Examples](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) directly in Rill. 

### Step 1: Let's create a new project and start rill developer


In  terminal we will create a new directory:

```
mkdir rill-custom-dashboards
cd rill-custom-dashboards
rill start 
```


#### Handle conflicts port conflicts rill developer
If would encounter the following error:
```
serve: server crashed: grpc port 49009 is in use by another process. Either kill that process or pass --port-grpc PORT to run Rill on another port
```
You can start Rill Developer on a new port using the following command:

```sh
rill start --port 10010 --port-grpc 10011
 ```

### Step 3: Adding data source
We will add new data source from https:

For this example let's use : 
https://storage.googleapis.com/medriscoll-rill/rilldemo-openrtb/bids_data.parquet


### Step 3: Adding feature flag

Edit the rill.yaml you can do this directly Rill Developer UI
Add : 
```
features:
 - customDashboards

```
### Step 4: Crete a Vega Charts

Custom dashboards are composed of one more more charts.
In menu you will now see the option to create charts and custom dashboards.

# Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/charts
    
type: component

data:
  sql: |
    SELECT * FROM (VALUES 
      ('Monday', 300),
      ('Tuesday', 150),
      ('Wednesday', 200),
      ('Thursday', 400),
      ('Friday', 650),
      ('Saturday', 575),
      ('Sunday', 500)
    ) AS t(day_of_week, revenue)

vega_lite: |
  {
    "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json",
    "data": { "name": "table" },
    "mark": "line",
    "width": "container",
    "encoding": {
      "x": {
        "field": "day_of_week",
        "type": "ordinal",
        "axis": { "title": "Day of the Week" },
        "sort": [
          "Monday",
          "Tuesday",
          "Wednesday",
          "Thursday",
          "Friday",
          "Saturday",
          "Sunday"
        ]
      },
      "y": {
        "field": "revenue",
        "type": "quantitative",
        "axis": { "title": "Revenue" }
      }
    }
  }
    ```
