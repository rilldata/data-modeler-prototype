## Creating Custom Dashboards in Rill 

In this section, we'll cover how to create custom dashboards in Rill Developer and publish these to Rill Cloud,
<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->

### Step 1: Let's create a new project and start rill developer


In  terminal we will create a new directory/project or use and existing project:

```
mkdir rill-custom-dashboards
cd rill-custom-dashboards
rill start 
```


#### Handle conflicts port conflicts rill developer
If would encounter the following error:
```
serve: server crashed: grpc port 49009 is in use by another process. Either kill that process or pass --port-grpc PORT to run Rill on another port
```
You can start Rill Developer on a new port using the following command:

```sh
rill start --port 10010 --port-grpc 10011
 ```

### Step 3: Adding data source
We will add new data source from https:

For this example let's use : 
https://storage.googleapis.com/medriscoll-rill/rilldemo-openrtb/bids_data.parquet


### Step 4: Adding feature flag ( no longer required once GA)

Edit the rill.yaml you can do this directly Rill Developer UI
Add : 
```
features:
 - customDashboards
