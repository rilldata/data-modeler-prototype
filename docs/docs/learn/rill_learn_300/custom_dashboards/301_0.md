## Creating Custom Dashboards in Rill 

In this section, we'll cover how to create custom dashboards in Rill Developer and publish these to Rill Cloud,
<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->

### Step 1: Let's return to our project my-rill-tutorial.

:::note Friends from ClickHouse
If you are coming from the Rill and ClickHouse course, we are using the following datasets!

```
gs://rilldata-public/github-analytics/Clickhouse/modified_files_*.parquet
gs://rilldata-public/github-analytics/Clickhouse/commits_*.parquet
```
You will need to comment out the olap_connector value in your rill.yaml
```yaml
#olap_connector:clickhouse
```
:::
From the terminal, let's start rill

```
rill start 
```

### Step 2: Adding feature flag (no longer required once GA)

Edit the rill.yaml via the UI and add the following:
```
features:
 - customDashboards
```


### Step 3: Notice the changes in the UI

You will now notice that under the `+Add` UI, two new options are available.

Once you select either of these, a dedicated folder `charts` and `custom-dashboards` will be created.
