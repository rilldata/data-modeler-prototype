data:
  metrics_sql: |
    SELECT advertiser_name, measure_2
    FROM Bids_Sample_Dash
    ORDER BY measure_2 DESC
    LIMIT 20

vega_lite: |
  {
    "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json",
    "data": {"name": "table"},
    "mark": "bar",
    "width": "container",
    "encoding": {
      "y": {"axis": {"orient": "left"}, "field": "advertiser_name", "type": "nominal", "sort": "-x"},
      "x": {"field": "measure_2", "type": "quantitative"}
    }
