### Let's continue with another custom chart example.

Let's say we want to see each user's addition and deletion of code over a set period in an easy to read way. 
Looking through Vega Lite's example gallery, we can see that a [Normalized Stacked Bar chart](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/stacked_bar_normalize.html) does this quite well.

### Creating a normalized stacked bar chart for addition vs deletion to repository

Let's use the `advanced_commits__model` table to obtain our data.


:::note Coming from Rill and ClickHouse course?
The advanced_commits_model file is created with the following contents, assuming you have already imported the data from [the first page](301_0.md).

WITH commit_file_stats AS (
    SELECT
        a.*,
        b.filename,
        b.added_lines,
        b.deleted_lines,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(b.new_path, '(.*/)', 1) AS directory_path, 
    FROM
        commits__ a
    inner JOIN
        modified_files__ b
    ON
        a.commit_hash = b.commit_hash
)
SELECT
    author_date,
    author_name,
    directory_path,
    filename,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT commit_msg, ', ') AS commit_msg,

    COUNT(DISTINCT commit_hash) AS num_commits,
    SUM(added_lines) - SUM(deleted_lines) AS net_line_changes, 
    SUM(added_lines) + SUM(deleted_lines) AS total_line_changes, 

    -- (SUM(deleted_lines) / (SUM(added_lines) + SUM(deleted_lines))) as CodeDeletePercent, 
    sum(added_lines) as added_lines,
    sum(deleted_lines) as deleted_lines, 

FROM
    commit_file_stats
WHERE
    directory_path IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    --directory_path, filename, author_name, author_date
    ALL
ORDER BY
    directory_path DESC 
```

**Preparing the Data**

In order to calculate the percentage of added vs deleted lines of code to the repository, we will need to include both `added_lines` and `deleted_lines` to the `SELECT` statement. As we will be grouping by the author, we will also need `author_name`.

<details>
  <summary>Click me for SQL</summary>
```sql
data:
  sql: |   
    select     
      author_name,
      sum(added_lines) as added_lines,
      sum(deleted_lines) as deleted_lines,
    from advanced_commits___model
    where author_date > '2024-07-21 00:00:00 Z'
    group by author_name
```
</details>

**Preparing the Visuals**

Navigating back to [Vega Lite documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/stacked_bar_normalize.html), we will see that the requirements to create this type of chart is different. We have a transform section as well as more items in the y-axis.

For further detailed explanation, I would recommened reviewing the [Vega Lite documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/transform.html). For now, understand that the following component folds the data into [author_name, added_lines, deleted_lines] and is using the data to compare the number of lines added/deleted.

**Custom Chart Complete**

With both components ready, your dashboard should look something like this:
