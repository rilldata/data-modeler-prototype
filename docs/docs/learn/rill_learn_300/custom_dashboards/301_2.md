<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->
More [Vega-Lite Examples](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) directly in Rill. 

### Step 1: Let's create a new project and start rill developer


In  terminal we will create a new directory/project or use and existing project:

```
mkdir rill-custom-dashboards
cd rill-custom-dashboards
rill start 
```


#### Handle conflicts port conflicts rill developer
If would encounter the following error:
```
serve: server crashed: grpc port 49009 is in use by another process. Either kill that process or pass --port-grpc PORT to run Rill on another port
```
You can start Rill Developer on a new port using the following command:

```sh
rill start --port 10010 --port-grpc 10011
 ```

### Step 3: Adding data source
We will add new data source from https:

For this example let's use : 
https://storage.googleapis.com/medriscoll-rill/rilldemo-openrtb/bids_data.parquet


### Step 3: Adding feature flag

Edit the rill.yaml you can do this directly Rill Developer UI
Add : 
```
features:
 - customDashboards

```
### Step 4: Crete a Vega Charts

Custom dashboards are composed of one more more charts.
In menu you will now see the option to create charts and custom dashboards.

Let's  a new chart with use the following as an example:

Here we are statically defining the values 

```
    
## Bar chart for top advertiser names

type: component
data:
  metrics_sql: |
    SELECT advertiser_name, measure_2
    FROM Bids_Sample_Dash
    ORDER BY measure_2 DESC
    LIMIT 20

vega_lite: |
  {
    "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json",
    "data": {"name": "table"},
    "mark": "bar",
    "width": "container",
    "encoding": {
      "y": {"axis": {"orient": "left"}, "field": "advertiser_name", "type": "nominal", "sort": "-x"},
      "x": {"field": "measure_2", "type": "quantitative"}
    }
  }

    ```

Expiriment with the different sort "-y" , "y" "x-" 

### Save your changes and let's create another chart
