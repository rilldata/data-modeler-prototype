**Welcome to Rill**


In this course, we will accomplish the following:

- Install the Rill binary locally [Linux/MacOS and Windows]
- Start Rill from the CLI and import our first dataset
- Connect to your Clickhouse Database
- Preview the data locally and explore how Rill works
- Deploy our dashboard onto Rill Cloud

<br />

If you have already started the <a href ='https://learn.clickhouse.com/visitor_catalog_class/show/1328973/ClickHouse-Developer-Learning-Path' target="_blank"> Clickhouse Developer On-demand course</a>, we will be utilizing the dataset, uk___. If not, I recommend heading over to our friends at ClickHouse to get started.


Let's get started.
