## Congratulations! 

### We are officially finished with Rill Advanced series.

This course was jam packed with a lot of features but now you should have a 'completed' project at your disposal to reference when you need.

Current project:
- a project deployed to Rill Cloud, via the UI or CLI
    - scheduled report, 
    - alert, 
    - bookmark,
    - public URL, and 
    - access policies set on our advanced_dashboard

- two GCS sources set to refresh every 24 hours.
- two models, one simple and one a bit more advanced
- two dashboards, one with some custom settings, one with advanced metrics settings
- three users: your admin account, an organization viewer part of the `tutorial-admin` group and a project specific viewer


:::note
In case you had any issues during the guide, we have uploaded the completed project to our <a href = 'https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/' target= "blank">GitHub repository </a> so you can clone it, if required.

### To the next course!
We're not quite done yet! While we have covered our basic and advanced features, there are still some customization that can be added on top. 

In the next series, Rill Expert, we will go into custom dashboards, custom APIs, and more!
