## Rill Cloud specific features
Since Rill Cloud is designed for dashboard consumers, there are some features here that are not available in Rill Developer.

1. <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/alerts/' target="_blank"> Alerts, </a>
2. <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/exports' target="_blank"> Scheduled Reports (dashboard exports), </a>
3. <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/share-url' target="_blank"> Shareable URLs </a> 

and more!

Please refer to our <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/dashboard-101' target=" blank">dashboard documentation page </a> for a detailed description of each of these features. We will build them into our project further in the course.
