## Welcome Back!


So, we've deployed to Rill Cloud. But... what is Rill Cloud and how was it different from Rill Developer? 

To summarize the previous course:

1. Rill Developer is for... Developers.
2. Rill Cloud are for dashboard consumers.
3. The features differ on both platforms. IE: Cloud can make shareable URLs, while Developer creates models and dashboards.

However, for a more indepth comparison between the two platforms, please refer to the concepts article: <a href= 'https://docs.rilldata.com/concepts/developerVsCloud' target="blank ">Rill Cloud vs. Rill Developer</a>.


## Rill Cloud UI
Let's look at some of the UI components to better understand Rill Cloud.

From the organization page, you can see a list of available projects. In this case, we just have our single, my-rill-tutorial project.


We will cover Rill Cloud's features within this Advanced course. But, we need to discuss an important topic first.

Now that my project is deployed on Cloud, how do I manage users and access?
