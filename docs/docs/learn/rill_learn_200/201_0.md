## Glad to see you made it!


So, we've deployed to Rill Cloud. But... what is Rill Cloud? How is it different from Rill Developer? 

To summarize the previous course:

1. Rill Developer is for... Developers.
2. Rill Cloud are for dashboard consumers.
3. The modifiable features differ on both platforms. IE: Cloud can make shareable URLs, while Developer creates dashboards.

However, for a more indepth comparison between the two platforms, please refer to the concepts article: [Rill Cloud vs. Rill Developer].


## Rill Cloud UI
Let's look at some of the UI components to better understand Rill Cloud.

From the organization list, you can select a single project to view the dashboards page.

As you can see, the UI is quite different from Rill Developer. We will cover most of Rill Cloud's features within this Advanced course. But, we need to discuss an important topic first.

Now that my data is on Cloud, how do I manage users and access?
