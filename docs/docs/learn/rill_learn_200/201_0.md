## Welcome Back!


So, we've deployed to Rill Cloud. But... what is Rill Cloud and how was it different from Rill Developer? 

To summarize the previous course:

1. Rill Developer is for... Developers and is run locally, `localhost`.
2. Rill Cloud are for dashboard consumers and available online, `https://ui.rilldata.com/<your_org>`
3. The features differ on both platforms. IE: Cloud can make shareable URLs, while Developer creates models and dashboards.

However, for a more indepth comparison between the two platforms, please refer to the concepts article: <a href= 'https://docs.rilldata.com/concepts/developerVsCloud' target="blank ">Rill Cloud vs. Rill Developer</a>.


## Rill Cloud UI
Let's take another look at some of the UI components to better understand Rill Cloud.

From the organization page, you can see a list of available projects, each displayed as a square in the UI. In this case, we just have our single project, my-rill-tutorial.


We will cover Rill Cloud's features within this Advanced course. But, we need to discuss an important topic first.

Now that my project is deployed on Cloud, how do I manage users and access?
