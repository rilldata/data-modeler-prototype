## Status Page

As you may have noticed (if you deployed via the UI), that we are taken to the Status page first. This gives us an overview of all the components within Rill Cloud, including the underlying source and models. While you will not be able to make any direct changes, the Status page is a good place to start when dashboards are acting strange.

You'll see here that there's an option to connect to GitHub.

## Connect to GitHub
During our first deployment onto Rill Cloud, we opted for a one-time upload. By doing so, we are able to directly deploy the project without any further steps, but we lose out on a few powerful capablities that can enhance the user experience, such as version control.

Let's go ahead and connect our project to a GitHub Repository.


### via UI
import ComingSoon from '@site/src/components/ComingSoon';

<ComingSoon />

<div id='contents_to_overlay'>

### via CLI

Navigating back to Terminal, we can run the following:
```
rill deploy
No git remote was found.
You can connect to Github or use one-time uploads to deploy your project.
? Do you want to use one-time uploads? No
```

We will be prompted with the same UI but this time select no. This time, you will be navigating to GitHub to install Rill Cloud to your account. Please proceed with the procedure and authorize the repository.

Once completed, you will hit the following UI and can return to the CLI.

Since we had deployed onto Rill Cloud earlier without GitHub, when you try to deploy this time, Rill will warn you that the project name is already used. Let's create a new project with the following name `my-rill-tutorial-git`.
```
? Select a Github account for the new repository <your_account>

Request submitted for creating repository. Checking completion status

Successfully created repository on "https://github.com/royendo/my-rill-tutorial"

Pushing local project to Github

Successfully pushed your local project to Github

Using org "Rill_Learn".

Rill project names are derived from your Github repository name.
The "my-rill-tutorial" project already exists under org "Rill_Learn". Please enter a different name.
? Enter a project name my-rill-tutorial-git
Created project "Rill_Learn/my-rill-tutorial-git". Use `rill project rename` to change name if required.

Rill projects deploy continuously when you push changes to Github.

Could not access all connectors. Rill requires credentials for the following connectors:

 - gcs (used by commits__ and others)

Run `rill env configure --project my-rill-tutorial` to provide credentials.

Your project can be accessed at: https://ui.rilldata.in/Rill_Learn/my-rill-tutorial-git
Opening project in browser...
```

That's it! You have connected your GitHub repository to your Rill project. Now navigating back to the Status page, you can see the repository listed. Now you can push any changes that you've made locally to the Git repository and Rill will automatically update. For more information on how to use GitHub with Rill, please refer to the <a href= 'http://localhost:4004/deploy/existing-project/github-101#pushing-changes' target ="blank" > GitHub Basics docs</a>!

Now that we've set this up, let's go back to Developer and make some changes to the SQL.
