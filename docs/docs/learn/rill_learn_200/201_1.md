## How to manage the users?

Historically (pre 0.48), user management was only possible via the CLI. Now, it is also possible to do so via the UI!

#### Let's add a user

Let's say you want to add another user to your Rill Organization, let's go over the steps to do so.

```
rill user add
```

This will prompt you for the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/roles-permissions' target="_blank">type of user </a>, `admin` or `viewer` 

Let's select `viewer` 

```
rill user add
? Select role `viewer`
? Enter email your_email@provider.com
User "your_email@provider.com" added to the organization "Rill_Learning" as "viewer"
```

You will now be able to see this user when listing out your users.
