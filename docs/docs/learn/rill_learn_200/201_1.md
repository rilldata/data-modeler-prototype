## How to manage the users?



## Via UI
Starting from 0.48, we are starting to roll out some UI features for user managment.

Please refer to the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/user-management#via-the-ui' target = "blank">documentation how a user can request access to project, or how an admin canset project access. </a>

import ComingSoon from '@site/src/components/ComingSoon';

<div class='contents_to_overlay'>
Historically (pre 0.48), user management was only possible via the CLI. Now, it is also possible to do so via the UI! 

</div>

## Via CLI

The two commands that you will need to use for user management in rill is `user` and `usergroup`.

### Let's see the Rill commands

```
Usage:
  rill user [command]

Available Commands:
  list        List
  add         Add
  remove      Remove
  set-role    Set Role
  whitelist   Whitelist access by email domain

Global Flags:
      --api-token string   Token for authenticating with the cloud API
      --format string      Output format (options: "human", "json", "csv") (default "human")
  -h, --help               Print usage
      --interactive        Prompt for missing required parameters (default true)
```

```
Usage:
  rill usergroup [command]

Available Commands:

  rename      Rename a user group
  edit        Edit a user group
  show        Show a user group
  list        List user groups
  delete      Delete a user group

  set         Set role to a user group in an organization or project
  remove      Remove role of a user group in an organization or prodject
```


### Let's check on the viewer we created [in an earlier course](../rill_learn_100/105_CLI/105_2.md)

```
rill user list

 NAME       EMAIL                   ROLE     CREATED ON            UPDATED ON           
 ---------- ----------------------- -------- --------------------- --------------------- 
  A Name     your_email@domain.com   viewer   2024-07-25 12:14:16   2024-07-25 12:14:16  
  Roy Endo   roy.endo@rilldata.com   admin    2024-07-03 15:34:42   2024-08-01 11:00:56  
  ```

From the output you should see your email as the `admin` and the other user as a `viewer`. The current command lists out the users in the organization, but what if we want to list  project specific users?

```
rill user list --project my-rill-tutorial

  NAME       EMAIL                   ROLE    CREATED ON            UPDATED ON           
 ---------- ----------------------- ------- --------------------- --------------------- 
  Roy Endo   roy.endo@rilldata.com   admin   2024-07-03 15:34:42   2024-08-01 11:00:56  
  
```


In the above, you'll find that only your user is listed. Why?
This is because we have specified the specific project. While your viewer will inherit view permissions onto the project, in the CLI, we separate the users.

### How to add project specific users?
```
rill user add --project <project_name>
```

Let's go ahead and add another user to a specific project. Note that this user will not appear when running `rill user list`. They will only be listed when specifying the project name.

```
rill user add --project my-rill-tutorial
? Select role viewer
? Enter email your_email2@gmail.com
```

```
rill user list --project my-rill-tutorial

  NAME       EMAIL                    ROLE     CREATED ON            UPDATED ON           
 ---------- ------------------------ -------- --------------------- --------------------- 
  A Name2    your_email2@gmail.com    viewer   2024-08-01 11:00:29   2024-08-01 11:00:29  
  Roy Endo   roy.endo@rilldata.com    admin    2024-07-03 15:34:42   2024-08-01 11:00:56  
```

### Usergroups

The last topic is managing user groups. As the name suggests, user groups are designed to group your users together so that you do not need to set permissions on each user and instead users can be added to a group and inherit permissions via the group.

By default, all-users will be created in your environment. Let's add a `tutorial-admin` group.
```
rill usergroup list

  NAME        ROLE   CREATED ON            UPDATED ON           
 ----------- ------ --------------------- --------------------- 
  all-users   -      2024-08-01 09:32:29   2024-08-01 09:32:29  
```

```
rill usergroup create

? Enter user group name tutorial-admin
User group "tutorial-admin" created in organization "Rill_Learn"
```
Now let's give admin access to the group for the project `my-rill-tutorial`.


```
rill usergroup add --project my-rill-tutorial
? Select role admin
? Enter user group name tutorial-admin
Role "admin" added to user group "tutorial-admin" in project "my-rill-tutorial"
```

Next, let's try to add both of our users to this group and see what happens.

```
rill user add  --group tutorial-admin
? Enter email your_email@gmail.com
User "m.royendo@gmail.com" added to the user group "tutorial-admin"

rill user add --group tutorial-admin
? Enter email your_email2@gmail.com
Error: user is not a member of the organization (InvalidArgument)
```

The cause for the second failure is because currently only users that are part of the organization can be added to a user-group. Since your_email2 was added as a project-specific user, this is not possible.

That about sums up user managment via the CLI. There are a lot of ways to mix up the permissions. Basically, we use a logical OR command to determine access. In other words, the highest permission granted will be the one applied, so if a user inherits admin via a group or specifically a project, they will be an admin. 

For more information on the topic, please refer to our <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/user-management#which-privilege-wins' target=" Blank"> User Management docs.</a>


:::note
As a summary, there are three levels of permission inheritance:
1. Organization, default
2. Project-level, add a --project flag to the user command
    ```
        rill user add --project <project_name>
    ```

3. Usergroup, add a --group flag to the user command
    ```
        rill user add --group <group_name>
    ```

Depending on the type of privilege you set, there are some differences in behavior, please refer to our <a href= 'https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/usergroup-management' target=" blank">User Group management docs </a> for more information.

Let's select our project, my-rill-tutorial, to see some differences between viewer and admin.
