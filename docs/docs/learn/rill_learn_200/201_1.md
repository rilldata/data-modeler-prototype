## How to manage the users?



## Via UI

import ComingSoon from '@site/src/components/ComingSoon';

<ComingSoon />

<div id='contents_to_overlay'>
Historically (pre 0.48), user management was only possible via the CLI. Now, it is also possible to do so via the UI! 

</div>

## Via CLI

As discussed in the Basics series, the Rill binary is a powerful tool and has many capabilities, including user management. 

### Let's see the rill user commands

```Manage users

Usage:
  rill user [command]

Available Commands:
  list        List
  add         Add
  remove      Remove
  set-role    Set Role
  whitelist   Whitelist access by email domain

Global Flags:
      --api-token string   Token for authenticating with the cloud API
      --format string      Output format (options: "human", "json", "csv") (default "human")
  -h, --help               Print usage
      --interactive        Prompt for missing required parameters (default true)
```

#### Let's add a viewer

Let's add another user to your organization as viewer so we can see the difference between the two types of user.

```
rill user add --project my-rill-tutorial
```

This will prompt you for the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/roles-permissions' target="_blank">type of user </a>, `admin` or `viewer`, as well as their email address.

Let's select `viewer` 

```
rill user add
? Select role `viewer`
? Enter email your_email@provider.com
User "your_email@provider.com" added to the project "Rill_Learn/my-rill-tutorial" as "viewer"
```

You will now be able to see this user when listing out your users.

```
rill user list --project my-rill-tutorial
```

:::note
There are three levels of privilege assignment in Rill. 
1. Organization, default
2. Project-level, add a --project flag to the user command
    ```
        rill user add --project <project_name>
    ```
3. Usergroup, add a --group flag to the user command
    ```
        rill user add --group <group_name>
    ```

Depending on the type of privilege you set, there are some differences in behavior, please refer to our <a href= 'https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/usergroup-management' target=" blank">User Group management docs </a> for more information.
:::

You will need to access the email to accept the invitation to the organization and view the project. Note that by default, all users in Rill have viewer access to the projects. 

Let's select our project, my-rill-tutorial, to see some differences between viewer and admin.

Some things to note:
1. As a viewer, you will not be able to see the status page,
2. Some features are not available as a viewer.

For a detailed description of the differences, please refer to our <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/roles-permissions' target=' blank'> Roles and permissions documentation. </a>

Let's look into some of these Cloud specific features!
