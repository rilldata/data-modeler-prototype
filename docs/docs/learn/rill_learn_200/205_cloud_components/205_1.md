## Alert!

While scheduled reports are good for reporting information, another important feature that we need are [alerts](https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/alerts/). Based on a condition defined, we can create an alert to send out to ensure that proper action is taken.

### Create an alert

Let's say we want to create an alert if any single user has submitted more than 5 commits to the repository.

You'll notice in the bottom half of the UI whether or not based on the current filter if your alert will be sent. In our case, we can see that an alert wil be sent. This alert will be sent whenever the data refreshes. In our case as we set the data to refresh every 24 hours, the alert will trigger every 24 hours. 

We can see all of the alerts from the project UI page.

Only project/org admins can manage alerts.
