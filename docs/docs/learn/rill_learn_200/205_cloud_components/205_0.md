## Pivot and Scheduled Reports

[Scheduling reports](https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/exports) is an important part of reporting. Via Scheduled Reports, you can setup a time-based export of [your pivot table](https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/filters/pivot).


### Source refresh
However, our datasets are currently static, we have not set up any [source refresh](https://docs.rilldata.com/build/connect/source-refresh). Let's add the following lines to the source yaml files and push these changes to Rill Cloud.


```yaml
refresh:
  every: 24h
```
<details>
  <summary>Unsure how to push to GitHub? </summary>

   You can use the following commands to add, commit and push the changes via the CLI.
   ```
    $ git add sources 
    $ git commit -m "24hr refresh to sources"
        [main ef81ff1] 24hr refresh to sources
        2 files changed, 8 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
    $ git push origin main

        Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.

        Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 473 bytes | 473.00 KiB/s, done.
        Total 5 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
        remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), completed with 3 local objects.
        To https://github.com/royendo/my-rill-tutorial.git
        07b0055..ef81ff1  main -> main

   ```

</details>



Now, Rill will automaticaly refresh the datasets (our GCS connection) every 24 hours.  We are now ready to setup the scheduled report!


### Set up a scheduled report

Navigating back to the pivot table, we can select `export`.

You will need to set the required fields as seen in the UI such as `title`, `frequency`, and `recipients`. Once done you can select `create` and view the scheduled export in the `Reports` tab of the project view.

Only project/org admins can manage reports.
