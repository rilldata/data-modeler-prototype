## Why bookmark?
[Bookmarks](https://docs.rilldata.com/explore/bookmarks) are handy for various reasons. Whether its creating a default home for your viewers, or creating a savepoint to come back to, you can create bookmarks on a Rill dashboard.

<br />


A user can create and manage only their own bookmarks while a project administrator can create and share bookmarks with all the viewers in the project via Managed bookmarks. Administrators can also set a `home view` for all users viewing the dashboard.

You can see the difference above in the UI that a viewer and an admin sees. Also, when creating a bookmark, an admin can select 'managed bookmarks' to share to others in the project.
