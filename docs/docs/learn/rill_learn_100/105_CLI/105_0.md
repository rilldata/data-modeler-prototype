**Ready to Deploy?**

In order to prepare the environment for deployment to Cloud we will need to return to the Terminal where we started Rill Developer to run a few commands.

Let's get started by running  <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/cli/' target="blank">`rill`</a> in the Terminal and seeing the output:

```
Rill CLI

Usage:
  rill [command]

Available Commands:
  start          Build project and start web app
  deploy         Deploy project to Rill Cloud
  env            Manage variables for a project

  -h, --help               Print usage
      --interactive        Prompt for missing required parameters (default true)
  -v, --version            Show rill version

Use "rill [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
It's quite a bit but dont worry, we don't need to worry about all of them... for now!

The ones we will use this time are as follows:
1. Create an Organization <a href = "https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/cli/org/" target="blank">(rill org) </a>
2. Create User <a href = "https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/cli/user/" target="blank">(rill user) </a>
3. Create/Manage credentials [not required] <a href = "https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/cli/env/" target="blank">(rill env) </a>
4. Deploy! <a href = "https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/cli/deploy" target="blank">(rill deploy) </a>

In our current example, we wont need to follow all the steps but 2 and 3 but we'll go over them for information purposes.
