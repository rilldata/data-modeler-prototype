We will go over user management in further detail in a later course. For now, you can follow along in creating a `viewer`.

```
rill user 

  list        List
  add         Add
  remove      Remove
  set-role    Set Role
  whitelist   Whitelist access by email domain
```


### Adding a user

Let's say you want to add another user to your Rill Organization, let's go over the steps to do so.

```
rill user add
```

This will prompt you for the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/roles-permissions' target="_blank">type of user </a>, `admin` or `viewer` 

Let's select `viewer` 

```
rill user add
? Select role `viewer`
? Enter email your_email@domain.com
User "your_email@domain.com" added to the organization "Rill_Learn" as "viewer"
```

Please take a moment to check your email to <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/user-management#logging-into-rill-cloud' target="_blank">
verify your user. </a> You will now be able to see this user when listing out your users.

```
rill user list
```

### Configuring env variables
In our case, the GCS data we are using is public so credentials are not required. However, when accessing your own data, you will need to use the below command to configure the credentials so that after pushing to Rill Cloud, the data can still be accessed.
```
rill env
  configure   Configures connector variables for all sources
  pull        Pull cloud credentials into local .env file
  push        Push local .env contents to cloud
  set         Set variable
  rm          Remove variable
  show        Show credentials and other variables
```



### Project Commands
Next, let's review the project command and list all the current projects.

```
rill project

  list        List all the projects
  show        Show project details
  edit        Edit the project details
  rename      Rename project
  delete      Delete the project
  status      Project deployment status
  logs        Show project logs
  describe    Retrieve detailed state for a resource
  refresh     Refresh the project's data sources
  reset       Re-deploy project

```

As we have not deployed the current project to Rill Cloud yet, *coming next*, our project list wil be empty,
```
rill project list

   No projects found

```
Let's change that by deploying our project.
