As mentioned, this is extra information and is not required for the Basics tutorial. We will go over these in the Advanced courses in-depth.

```
rill user 

  list        List
  add         Add
  remove      Remove
  set-role    Set Role
  whitelist   Whitelist access by email domain
```


#### Let's add a user

Let's say you want to add another user to your Rill Organization, let's go over the steps to do so.

```
rill user add
```

This will prompt you for the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/roles-permissions' target="_blank">type of user </a>, `admin` or `viewer` 

Let's select `viewer` 

```
rill user add
? Select role `viewer`
? Enter email your_email@provider.com
User "your_email@provider.com" added to the organization "Rill_Learning" as "viewer"
```

You will now be able to see this user when listing out your users.

Next, let's review the project command. 


```
rill project

  list        List all the projects
  show        Show project details
  edit        Edit the project details
  rename      Rename project
  delete      Delete the project
  status      Project deployment status
  logs        Show project logs
  describe    Retrieve detailed state for a resource
  refresh     Refresh the project's data sources
  reset       Re-deploy project

```
As we have not deployed yet, *coming next*, our project list wil be empty,
```
rill project list

   No projects found

```
Let's change that by deploying our project.
