## Step 1. Create an Organization

Let's go ahead and see the options when running 
```
rill org
```

Pretty straight forward, we can do the following:

```
  create      Create organization
  edit        Edit organization details
  switch      Switch to other organization
  list        List all organizations
  delete      Delete organization
  rename      Rename organization
```

Let's go ahead and create an organization with the name `Rill-Tutorial`

```
rill org create Rill-Learn
```

  <summary>What's an organization?</summary>
  
    An organization is the broadest group in Rill Data. Within an organization contains all of your projects, and you can define access to the projects via <a href = 'https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/roles-permissions'>Roles and Permissions</a>.

    If you skip this step, Rill will automatically set an organization name.
