### Alternative deployment method

For those who want, we have provided a way to deploy via the CLI, as well. If you have already deployed via the UI and are not interested in the CLI, you can skip to the next page, [here](../107_0.md)

### Deploy via CLI

Let's head back to the Terminal to run the following:

```
rill deploy


No git remote was found.
You can connect to Github or use one-time uploads to deploy your project.
? Do you want to use one-time uploads? (Y/n) 
```

You'll see two options appear in the UI:

1. Deploying with GitHub
2. One-time upload.

For now, let's go ahead and select option 2, One-time upload by typing `Y` in the UI.

```
Do you want to use one-time uploads? Y
Using org "Rill-Learn".

Starting upload.
All files uploaded successfully.

Created project "Rill-Learn/my-rill-tutorial". Use `rill project rename` to change name if required.

Could not access all connectors. Rill requires credentials for the following connectors:

 - gcs (used by commits__ and others)

Run `rill env configure --project test` to provide credentials.

Your project can be accessed at: https://ui.rilldata.com/Rill_Learn/my-rill-project
Opening project in browser...
```
:::note 
As mentioned, the dataset we are using for this course is public so there will be no issues with accessing the data in Rill Cloud, but in case of your own data, you will need to run `rill env configure` before deploying
:::
Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your project to Rill Cloud!
