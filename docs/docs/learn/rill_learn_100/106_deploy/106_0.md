**You've made it to the last step!**


Just one more step to have our project deployed onto Rill Cloud. Let's jump right into it. Starting from 0.48, we have added a feature to deploy via the UI. If you are unsure what version you are on, please run:
```
rill version
```
Depending on your version and how you'd like to deploy, please proceed accordingly.

### Deploy via CLI

Let's head back to the Terminal to run the following:

```
rill deploy


No git remote was found.
You can connect to Github or use one-time uploads to deploy your project.
? Do you want to use one-time uploads? (Y/n) 
```

You'll see two options appear in the UI:

1. Deploying with GitHub
2. One-time upload.

For now, let's go ahead and select option 2, One-time upload by typing `Y` in the UI.

```
Do you want to use one-time uploads? Y
Using org "Rill-Learn".

Starting upload.
All files uploaded successfully.

Created project "Rill-Learn/my-rill-tutorial". Use `rill project rename` to change name if required.

Could not access all connectors. Rill requires credentials for the following connectors:

 - gcs (used by commits__ and others)

Run `rill env configure --project test` to provide credentials.

Your project can be accessed at: https://ui.rilldata.com/Rill_Learn/my-rill-project
Opening project in browser...
```
> As mentioned, the dataset we are using for this course is public so there will be no issues with accessing the data in Rill Cloud, but in case of your own data, you will need to run `rill env configure` before deploying

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your project to Rill Cloud!
