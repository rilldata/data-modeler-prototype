## Getting Started

After running the second command, Rill Developer should have automatically opened in your default browser. If not, please run the command again and Rill will create a new directory 'my-rill-project' in the folder you are in.


```yaml
rill start my-rill-tutorial
```

You should see the folowing webpage appear. 

![my-rill-project](/img/tutorials/101/new-rill-project.png)
<br />

Let's go ahead and select `Start with an empty project`.

  <summary>Where am I in the terminal?</summary>
  
    You can use the `pwd` command to see which directory in the terminal you are. <br />
    If this is not where you'd like to make the directory use the `cd` command to change directories.
