There are more customizations that we can add to the YAML file. Feel free to experiment with the following key pairs to customize you dashboard.


### Configuration ###
For some basic configurations for the metrics-view:

```yaml
smallest_time_grain: day #this limits that smallest amount a user can drill
first_day_of_week: 7 #Whether you prefer a Sunday start or Monday, how about Wednesday?
first_month_of_year: 2 #Usually its January, but who knows? Lunar New Years?
```

<br />

### Defaults ###
For setting default view when the dashboard is opened by a new user:

```yaml
default_time_range: P1M #valid ISO 8601, RILL ISO 8601
default_comparison: #defaults to none,
	mode: dimension #none,time,dimension
	dimension: Company#column name
	#sets the dashboard to compare companies by default.
default_dimensions: #default selected dimensions when dashboard is open
default_measures: #default selected measures when dashboard is open
default_theme: #must be pre-created under /theme/<theme_name>.yaml
```

<img src = '/img/tutorials/103/dashboard-defaults.gif' class='rounded-gif' />
<br />


### Available selectors ###
If you want to limit the default selection of time ranges and time zones

```yaml
available_time_zones: #overrides the default time ranges that can be selected by users
available_time_ranges: #overrides the default list of time ranges that can be selected by users
```


### Other ###
These will be discussed in a further topic, but you can set a OLAP engine on a specific dashboard as well as set up access policies.

```yaml
connector: <OLAP_ENGINE>
security: ...
```

	As you can see in the GIFs, you can use any visual editor, in this case VSCode, to modify the project YAML files. It will automatically update the preview as you save the file. For more information please refer to the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/build/dashboards/#multi-editor-and-external-ide-support' target="_blank"> IDE support section</a> of our documentation.

Let's build out our dashboard for a bit more functionality!
