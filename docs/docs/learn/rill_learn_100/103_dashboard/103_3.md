Let's add further dimensions and measures.

1. Dimensions

	From our dataset, we can add more dimensions to allow more filtering and exploration of the measures we will create.

	Add the following dimensions, with title and description.
		- author_name
		- author_timezone
		- filename

2. Measures	

	We can definitely create better aggregations for some more meaningful data based on these commits.
		- sum(added_lines)
		- sum(deleted_lines)


You may need to reference the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/dashboards' target="_blank">dashboard YAML </a> reference guide to figure out the above. Your final output should look something like this!
