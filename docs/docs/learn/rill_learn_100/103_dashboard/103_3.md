Let's put all the topics that we learned into a single dashboard.

1. Dimensions

	From our dataset, we can add more dimensions to allow more filtering and exploration of the measures we will create.

	Add the following dimensions
		- ColumnA
		- ColumnB
		- ColumnC

2. Measures	

	We can definitely create better aggregations for some more meaningful data based on these commits.
		- aggr(ColD)
		- aggr(ColE)
		- aggr(ColF)

3. Defaults

	Let's add some defaults for when a user opens the dashboard.
		- default_time_range
		- default_comparison
		- default_measures
		- default_dimensions

4. Configuration 
	
	Let's add some basic configuration for the timeseries
		- Smallest time can drill
		- first day of week on Sunday
