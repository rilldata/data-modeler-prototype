Let's put all the topics that we learned into a single dashboard.

1. Dimensions

	From our dataset, we can add more dimensions to allow more filtering and exploration of the measures we will create.

	Add the following dimensions, with title and description.
		- author_name
		- author_timezone
		- filename
		- project_name

2. Measures	

	We can definitely create better aggregations for some more meaningful data based on these commits.
		- sum(added_lines)
		- sum(deleted_lines)


3. Defaults

	Let's add some defaults for when a user opens the dashboard.
		- default_time_range, Past 1 Month
		- default_comparison, defaults to the dimension, filename
		- default_dimensions, everything but project_name 

4. Configuration 
	
	Let's add some basic configuration for the timeseries
		- Smallest time can drill, day
		- first day of week on Sunday


You may need to reference the <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/dashboards' target="_blank">dashboard YAML </a> reference guide to figure out the above. Your final output should look something like this!
