### Our current metrics view state: 
```yaml
# Dashboard YAML
# Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/dashboards

type: metrics_view #the type is required for all YAML files in Rill to define the type

title: "Dashboard Title"
table: example_table # Choose a table [or model] to underpin your dashboard / 
timeseries: timestamp_column # Select an actual timestamp column (if any) from your table

dimensions:
  - column: category
    label: "Category"
    description: "Description of the dimension"

measures:
  - expression: "SUM(revenue)"
    label: "Total Revenue"
    description: "Total revenue generated"

```

Let's go through the key pair one by one to preview the dashboard.

---

### Type ###

```yaml
type: metrics_view
```
The type is a Rill required key pair as it indicates to Rill what type of file this is. Whether a `source`, `metrics_vew`, `connector`, etc. We can keep this as is.

---

### Title and underlying table ###
```yaml
title: "My Tutorial dashboard"

#table: example_table # OR
model: commit___model #_ _ _, there are three underbars there!
```
The title will be displayed in the metrics-view UI and should be defined as required. <br />
Depending on your use-case, `table` or `model` will be used to underpin your dashboard.<br />

Let's go ahead and change the title to `My Tutorial dashboard` and comment out the table and add `model: commit___model`.


---

### Time series ###
```yaml
timeseries: author_date # Select an actual timestamp column (if any) from your table
```
The timeseries column is a Date type column within your table. While technically this is not required, many of the features require a timeseries column and your resulting dashboard will lack key functionality. Let's set this to `author_date`.

---
### Dimensions ###
```yaml

dimensions:
  - column: author_name #the column name in the table
    label: "The Author's Name" #A label
    description: "The name of the author of the commit" #A description, displayed when hovered over dimension

```
Dimensions are used for exploring segments and filtering the dashboard. Each dimension hve a set of required key pairs. For the `column`, you will need to set it to a column from your model or table, assign it a label (this is how it's labeled in the dashboard) and provide a description. The description will be displayed when hovering over, and can provide more context.

Our first dimension wil be the author's name. Let's go ahead and make the changes above.

---
### Measures ###

```yaml
measures:
  - expression: "SUM(added_lines)"
    label: "Sum of Added lines"
    description: "The aggregate sum of added_lines column"
```

Measure are the numeric aggreagtes of columns from your data model. These function will use DuckDB SQL aggregation functions and expressions. Similar to dimensions, you will need to create an expression based on the column of your underlying model or table.

Our first measure will be: `SUM(added_lines)`.

---

At this point our dashboard should be previewable! 
Let's go ahead a select preview so we can take a look. You should see something similar to the below.

We can definitely do better than that!

  <summary>Dashboard not working?</summary>
  
    Go ahead and copy the YAML below into your dashboard.
  ```yaml
# Dashboard YAML
# Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/dashboards

type: metrics_view

title: "My Tutorial Project"
#table: example_table # Choose a table to underpin your dashboard
model: commits___model

timeseries: author_date # Select an actual timestamp column (if any) from your table

dimensions:
  - column: author_name
    label: "The Author's Name"
    description: "The name of the author of the commit"

measures:
  - expression: "SUM(added_lines)"
    label: "Sum of Added lines"
    description: "The aggregate sum of added_lines column."


```
