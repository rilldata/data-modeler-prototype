**OLAP Engines**

Under the hood, we utilize OLAP engines to power our dashboards. Unlike traditional relational databases or data warehouses, OLAP databases are designed for query speed and complex analysis. This allows for fast query times and real-time data analysis.

By default we use DuckDB but with a single modification can change this to various other engines such as ClickHouse.
