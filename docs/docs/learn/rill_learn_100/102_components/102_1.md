Let's start at the beginning of all data pipelines, the `source`.

### What is a Source?

In Rill, the source is your data. Whether this is from a data warehouse, cloud storage, or a RDB, Rill can connect to it via an underlying DuckDB process. 

> By default, the underlying OLAP engine is DuckDB (can be modified: see <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/build/olap/' target="_blank"> Connect OLAP engines</a>) and when connecting to an external data source, the data is ingested locally.

Please see our docs for a full 
<a href="https://docs.rilldata.com/build/connect/" target="_blank">supported list</a> of connectors.




### Adding a source is simple! 

Select the `+Add` dropdown and select `Data`, this will open a UI of supported connectors.

For our tutorial, let's add two GCS storage from our public storage.

```yaml 
 gs://rilldata-public/github-analytics/Clickhouse/modified_files_*.parquet
 gs://rilldata-public/github-analytics/Clickhouse/commits_*.parquet
```

Once imported, youll see the UI change with a few things..
1. The `source_name`.YAML file created in the file explorer
1. DuckDB database, created in the Connectors explorer
2. Within the DuckDB database, our imported data as a table with a preview.
3. The right panel giving a summary of the data

Now we're ready to create a `model`.

    We are continually adding new sources and connectors in our releases. For a comprehensive list, you can refer to our <a href=''>connectors page</a>. Please don't hesitate to <a href='https://docs.rilldata.com/contact'>reach out</a> either if there's a connector you'd like us to add!

    If this it your first time, you may need to refresh the browser for DuckDB to appear in the UI.
