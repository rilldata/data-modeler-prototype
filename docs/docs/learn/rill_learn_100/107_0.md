### Congratulations!

You have successfully deployed your project from Rill Developer to Rill Cloud!



### Key Takeaways

1. Rill Developer and Rill Cloud are to be used in together, one is not 'better' than the other.
2. While the UI is an easy way to make changes, understanding the YAML is important, too!
3. By default, we use DuckDB as the underlying OLAP engine. You can change this if required.
4. We recommend materializing the model into table (from view) for your dashboard
5. It is super straight-forward to deploy to Rill Cloud

While the basic project is finished and deployed, there are still many more features in our product, with new ones coming out regularly! Please continue onto our next series, Rill Advanced, to dive into Rill Cloud's features. 



Also, we have a Guides section below the tutorial where we will be uploading independent how-to guides, interesting projects, etc. Feel free to browse through those, as well!
