Dashboards that move as fast as your business. Build fast operational dashboards that your team will actually use.  

Unlike most BI tools, Rill comes with its own embedded in-memory database. Data and compute are co-located, and queries return in milliseconds. So you can pivot, slice, and drill-down into your data instantly.   

Download Rill to start modeling data and create fast, exploratory dashboards.

```
curl https://rill.sh | sh
rill start my-rill-project
```

Rill's design principles:
- _**Feels good to use**_ – powered by Sveltekit & DuckDB = conversation-fast, not wait-ten-seconds-for-result-set fast
- _**Works with your local and remote datasets**_ – imports and exports Parquet and CSV (s3, gcs, https, local)
- _**No more data analysis "side-quests"**_ – helps you build intuition about your dataset through automatic profiling
- _**No "run query" button required**_ – responds to each keystroke by re-profiling the resulting dataset
- _**Radically simple interactive dashboards**_ – thoughtful, opinionated, interactive dashboard defaults to help you quickly derive insights from your data
- _**Dashboards as code**_ – each step from data to dashboard has versioning, Git sharing, and easy project rehydration
