```

```

![home-demo](https://github.com/rilldata/rill/assets/5587788/49d17e80-5f27-408c-bbc9-fdbff7b6b627 "829237828")

Rill's design principles:
- _**Feels good to use**_ – powered by Sveltekit & DuckDB = conversation-fast, not wait-ten-seconds-for-result-set fast
- _**Works with your local and remote datasets**_ – imports and exports Parquet and CSV (s3, gcs, https, local)
- _**No more data analysis "side-quests"**_ – helps you build intuition about your dataset through automatic profiling
- _**No "run query" button required**_ – responds to each keystroke by re-profiling the resulting dataset
- _**Radically simple interactive dashboards**_ – thoughtful, opinionated, interactive dashboard defaults to help you quickly derive insights from your data
- _**Dashboards as code**_ – each step from data to dashboard has versioning, Git sharing, and easy project rehydration
