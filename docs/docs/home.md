Dashboards that move as fast as your business. Build fast operational dashboards that your team will actually use.  

Unlike most BI tools, Rill comes with its own embedded in-memory database. Data and compute are co-located, and queries return in milliseconds. So you can pivot, slice, and drill-down into your data instantly.   

Download Rill to start modeling data and create fast, exploratory dashboards.

```
curl https://rill.sh | sh
rill start my-rill-project
```
