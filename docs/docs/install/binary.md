```
cd downloads
rill init
rill import-source /path/to/data_1.parquet
rill start
```

## Safely open Rill on your Mac
If you see a warning when opening the rill macos-arm64 binary you need to change the permissions to make it executable and remove it from Apple Developer identification quarantine.
```
cd downloads
chmod a+x rill
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./rill
```
