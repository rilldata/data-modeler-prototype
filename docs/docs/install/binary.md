# How to install a Rill binary
Our install script is the fastest way to download Rill Developer and make it a globally accessible binary:
```
curl -s https://cdn.rilldata.com/install.sh | bash
```

Nightly build:
```
curl -s https://cdn.rilldata.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --nightly
```

Nightly builds for M1 Mac (arm64) use [Applesâ€™s Rosetta emulator](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861), which may be less performant than native weekly builds. 

Alternatively, you can manually download the latest binary that is relevant for your OS and architecture.

## Safely open Rill on your Mac
If you see a warning when opening the rill macos-arm64 binary you need to change the permissions to make it executable and remove it from Apple Developer identification quarantine.
```
cd ~/Downloads
chmod a+x rill
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./rill
```
Unlike the script-based installation, a manual download will not make Rill Developer globally accessible, so you'll need to reference the full path of the binary when executing CLI commands.
