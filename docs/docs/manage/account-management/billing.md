## Overview

Billing cycles begin on the first of the every month (12:00am UTC). If you start your plan mid-monthm, your first month will be pro-rated accordingly. 


### How does it work? 
Rill Data does not use a user-based license system. Instead, we calculate your data usage, after ingestion, and calculate the pricing based on this. For more information on pricing, see our [pricing page](https://www.rilldata.com/pricing).
