Settings in Rill Cloud give an easy access to manage objects and ensure that everything is working as expected.

There are two different levels of settings. 
1. Organization Settings (Coming soon!)
2. Project Settings


:::tip 
Starting from version 0.50, we are beginning to port the ability to manage objects in Rill within Rill Cloud. This includes, public URLs (currently released), user and group management, and more!
