Settings in Rill Cloud give an easy access to manage objects and ensure that everything is working as expected.



:::tip 
Starting from version 0.50, we are beginning to port the ability to manage objects in Rill Cloud within the Rill Cloud UI. This includes, public URLs (currently released), user and group management, and more!
:::

## Public URL

Within the settings page, you can copy the URL of an existing public URL, delete existing public URLs, and check owner and last access date.
