/** This function implements a point-pushing algorithm that prevents
 * y values from overlapping. It is used to prevent labels from
 * overlapping in a data graphic.
 * The algorithm is as follows:
 * 1. Sort the points by y value.
 * 2. If there is only one point, return it.
 * 3. If there are no points, return an empty array.
 * 4. Calculate the middle index.
 * 5. Adjust the position of the points above the middle index.
 * 6. Adjust the position of the top point and push down overlapping points.
 * 7. Adjust the position of the points below the middle index.
 * 8. Adjust the position of the bottom point and push up overlapping points.
 * We can't claim that this works for every case, but it seems to work
 * in most cases we care about.
