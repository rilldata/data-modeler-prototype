  "description": "To create dashboards for a set of stakeholders, external users or other partners, start by creating a Parent dashboard view that contains all of the dimensions and metrics you wish to display. That parent dashboard can then be filtered by a set of criteria that then limits the data available to each user you wish to grant access. Further, that child dashboard can be embedded to be a specific application view within your product/portal for that set of users.",
