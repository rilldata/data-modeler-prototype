To add a new user, select **Add User** on the top right of the screen. 
  * Add an email address (if the user email is within your domain, you will have the option to add as an Admin or Member) 
  * Select the security policies (which determine the dashboards visible to the user). See [Assigning dashboards to users](/admin-security) for adding/editing security policies
  * Send the invite (user receives link to edit password and access Rill)

:::info Internal vs. Guest Users
By default, anyone with the email domain for your company is an Internal user. Any user with an external domain is created as a Guest. 

Security is managed via Security Policies and Guest users can never access Admin rights.
