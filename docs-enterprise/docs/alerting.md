:::info Applied Filters
In the alerts window, you'll see the applied filters for the existing alert. Any combination of dimensions can be used to set alerts on specific values.
:::

Alerting is opportune for any troubleshooting or measurement use case. In particular:

  * Campaign delivery rates vs. expectations (e.g. zero values at start)
  * % drop/increase in expected revenue (by product/publisher)
  * Minimum partner spend
  * Changes in inventory
  * % change vs. regional benchmarks 

Once an alert is set, you can view/edit the alert in the Admin panel on the top right (the user icon dropdown).
