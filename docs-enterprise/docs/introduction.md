## Welcome

Rill Data provides a fully managed cloud data service that enables teams to deliver real time metrics dashboards to their business stakeholders. 

The platform adds security, elastic scaling and job monitoring on top of:

  * [an open source tool to effortlessly transform data](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-developer)
  * a high performance, real-time analytics database (Apache Druid) 
  * [metrics dashboards that are fast, interactive, and easy-to-use](/getting-started)

Combining these three pieces of the modern data stack creates a fast-path for data engineers, analysts and business stakeholders to quickly collaborate and drive value from high volume, high velocity data.
