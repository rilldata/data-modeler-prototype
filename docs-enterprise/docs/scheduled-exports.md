## Scheduled Exports

Scheduled exports provide the ability for regular reporting based on a series of dimensions and metrics. 

You can schedule downloads of a specific dimension from Explore or alternatively schedule a Facet export for a fully filtered report.

After selecting the Scheduled export, the window appears to set up the time period (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), the reporting window, and to add additional users (*optional*)
