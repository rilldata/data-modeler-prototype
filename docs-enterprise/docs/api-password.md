## Overview 

If you want to use an application that makes API calls to Druid, you can create an API password and authenticate the API call using your Rill login and the API password. This is an alternative to using a [Service Account](/service-accounts), which is an account that your admin can create to allow multiple users to access Druid through an application via a single authorized user.

## Creating an API Password

Create or access your API password logging into Rill and clicking on your name in the left tab of Rill. This will display a popup with the workspaces available to you and an Account menu item at the bottom.

Click on Account to display your Account page. In the API Password section, click Enable to enable your API password and to set that password.

Your username will be your registration email. If your password is already enabled but you don't know what it is, you can also change your password here.
