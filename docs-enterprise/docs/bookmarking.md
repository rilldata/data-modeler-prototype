## Setting Bookmarks

Bookmarks are useful to return to regular analyses and filter sets commonly used for reporting or deep dives. 

If you have a regular view of the data, a bookmark is also a good replacement rather than creating an entirely new dashboard as it contains a subset of the view while retaining all of the fields available for analysis.

To start, you select the Bookmark logo on the top right of the screen *(bookmarks can also be found next to the title of your dashboard in Explore and in the Facet views)*.

Selecting the Bookmark icon brings up the modal to name your bookmark as shown below.

Once saved, your Bookmarks are available in the dropdown to return to your saved view.
