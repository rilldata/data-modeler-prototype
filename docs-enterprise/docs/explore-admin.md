Within the admin, you'll see a list of assets within Explore that you can edit - Company details, Dashboards, Security Policies and [Users](/adding-users) *(My Profile, Alerts & Scheduled Exports are available to all users)*. 

SSO is also available upon request.

Dashboards and Users are tied together by Security Polices which control what data is visible to which users. More details can be found in the [Permissions guide](/admin-security).
