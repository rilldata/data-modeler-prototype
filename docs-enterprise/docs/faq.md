There are several situations where Rill may not process data. Events that can not be processed fall into several categories and will be handled in the following ways:

  * Events posted unsuccessfully will be returned with status code: 420 or 503.
  * Events posted successfully (status code: 201) but with a file error (e.g. End of File error) will stall the pipeline. 
  * Events posted successfully but with invalid elements (e.g. malformed timestamp) will be dropped, and at this time no method exists to notify of this error.
  * Valid files with valid but incorrect JSON (e.g. wrong field name or incorrect nesting) will drop the fields corresponding to the incorrectly formed JSON.

Our pricing model is a usage-based model similar to most cloud providers.

Billing is based on: 
  * volume and/or processing of the data being ingested
  * type of data storage (hot, cold, archival memory) 
  * compute required for unusual query volume (above amounts included with your storage capacity) 

You can [review our pricing page for more information](https://www.rilldata.com/pricing).
