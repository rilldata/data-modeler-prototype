# Why we believe in a strong community policy

Our goal is to foster a community that can grow in our data practice and build new tools that break the mold on what people think is possible today. Trust and safety is critical in building a strong community where we can share ideas and ask questions. This is impossible if people feel threatened, harassed or discriminated against.
 
To this end, all Rill Data Community members are asked to read and adhere to this community policy so we have a shared understanding of the kind of courtesy we want to show each other. These guidelines will be enforced by Rill Data Community Administrators and Leaders.

## Anti-harassment policy
Rill Data Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. *We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.*

This code of conduct applies to all Rill Data Community spaces, including our Github and Slack workspaces both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Rill Community Admins.

Some Rill Data Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:
  * Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
  * Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
  * Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names.
  * Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate.
  * Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "*hug*" or "*backrub*") without consent or after a request to stop.
  * Threats of violence.
  * Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
  * Deliberate intimidation.
  * Stalking or following.
  * Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
  * Sustained disruption of discussion including annoying, rude or distracting behavior.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
  * Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
  * Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
  * Publication of non-harassing private communication.
  * Malice towards others such as deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling someone they’re 'not a real data practitioner' or that they don’t belong in the Rill Data Community.  Refrain from repsonding in a condescending manner with '...well actually's.

# Reporting Harassment
We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Rill Data Community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. You can report violations of this policy directly to community@rilldata.com.

# Consequences of Harassment
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Rill Community Admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Rill Data Community spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Rill Data Community members or the general public.

## Sharing Protected Information
The Rill Data Community is open to all and we do not garuntee protection when you are sharing information in this space. Please use your best judgment when you are participating. It is your responsibility to not violate active Non-Disclosure Agreements, share protected Intelectual Property, share datasets, or share data visualizations that you do not have the authority to share in a public space.  

## Soliciting Community Members
Cold promotional DMs to our members are strongly discouraged and may be ground for expulsion from the Rill Data Community. If you want to share these kinds of opportunities, please use the #promotions slack channel.
  * Do not solicit our community members with job opportunities or employment requests.
  * Do not solicit our community members as a method of lead generation for your a product you directly benefit from financially.
