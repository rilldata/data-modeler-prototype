# Rill Developer **_(tech preview)_**
Rill Developer makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create powerful, opinionated dashboards. Rill's principles:

- _**feels good to use**_ – powered by Sveltekit & DuckDB = conversation-fast, not wait-ten-seconds-for-result-set fast
- _**works with your local and remote datasets**_ – imports and exports Parquet and CSV (s3, gcs, https, local)
- _**no more data analysis "side-quests"**_ – helps you build intuition about your dataset through automatic profiling
- _**no "run query" button required**_ – responds to each keystroke by re-profiling the resulting dataset
- _**radically simple dashboards**_ – thoughtful, opinionated defaults to help you quickly derive insights from your data
- _**dashboards as code**_ – each step from data to dashboard has versioning, git sharing, and easy project rehydration
