# Rill Developer **_(tech preview)_**
Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create powerful, opinionated dashboards. Rill Developer follows a few guiding principles:

- *feels good to use* – powered by Sveltekit & DuckDB = conversation-fast, not wait-ten-seconds-for-result-set fast
- *works with your local datasets* – imports and exports Parquet and CSV
- *no more data analysis "side-quests"* – helps you build intuition about your dataset through automatic profiling
- *no "run query" button required* – responds to each keystroke by re-profiling the resulting dataset
- *radically simple dashboards* - thoughtful, opinionated defaults to help you quickly derive insights from your data


It's best to show and not tell, so here's a little preview of Rill Developer:
