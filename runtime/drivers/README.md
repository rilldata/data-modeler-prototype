Each driver in the package can implement one or more of following interfaces:

Following interfaces are system interfaces and is present for all instances. Depending on cloud/local these can be shared with all instances or private to an instance as well. Global connectors are passed as runtime configs. Instance specific connectors are set in instance while creating instance.
- **OLAPStore** for storing data and running analytical queries
- **CatalogStore** for storing sources, models and metrics views, including metadata like last refresh time
- **RepoStore** for storing code artifacts (this is essentially a file system shim)
- **RegistryStore** for tracking instances (DSNs for OLAPs and repos, instance variables etc)

Following interfaces are only available as source connectors. These are always instance specific connectors.
- **ObjectStore** for downloading files from remote object stores like s3,gcs etc
- **SQLStore** for runnning arbitrary SQL queries against DataWarehouses like bigquery. Caution: Not to be confused with postgres, duckdb etc.
- **FileStore** stores path for local files.

Special interfaces. Also instance specific.
- **Transporter** for transfering data from one infra to other.
